## Current State Analysis & Technical Findings

### Existing Architecture Assessment

**Existing Components Found:**
- ✅ `components/platform/ai-management/unified/UnifiedOverviewTab.tsx` - Foundation exists
- ✅ `components/platform/ai-management/unified/FeatureSidebar.tsx` - Sidebar navigation started
- ✅ `components/platform/ai-management/features/FeatureDashboard.tsx` - Performance dashboard component
- ✅ `components/platform/ai-management/features/FeatureModelAssignment.tsx` - Model assignment interface
- ✅ `components/platform/ai-management/unified/ConsolidatedSettingsTab.tsx` - Settings consolidation started
- ✅ Navigation structure at `/platform/ai-management/` routes established

**Current Navigation Pattern:**
- Multi-page navigation between Overview, Features, Models, Prompts, Spending, Testing
- Secondary sidebar exists specifically for AI management (`AIManagementNavigation.tsx`)
- Individual feature dashboards accessible via `/platform/ai-management/features/{id}`

**API Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Standard CRUD operations exist for features, models, prompts
- ✅ Endpoints: `/api/platform/ai-management/features`, `/api/platform/ai-management/models`
- ❌ Missing: Real-time streaming, integrated testing, log access APIs

### Critical Technical Gaps Identified

#### 1. Real-time Infrastructure Missing
**Gap:** PRD assumes WebSocket/SSE infrastructure that doesn't exist
**Impact:** Real-time metrics updates, live monitoring, instant status changes
**Required Infrastructure:**
- WebSocket connection management with automatic reconnection
- Server-Sent Events fallback for restrictive network environments
- Redis pub/sub for multi-instance deployments
- Rate limiting and connection throttling

#### 2. Integrated Testing Architecture Undefined
**Gap:** No existing embedded testing infrastructure found
**Impact:** Cannot implement "Test Model" and "Test Prompt" buttons as specified
**Required Infrastructure:**
- Sandboxed test execution environment
- Test result persistence with 30-day retention
- Integration with existing AI provider APIs
- Test artifact storage (images, logs, responses)

#### 3. Log Streaming Infrastructure Missing
**Gap:** No existing log drawer or streaming log components
**Impact:** Cannot implement drawer-based log access from configuration sections
**Required Infrastructure:**
- Centralized log aggregation (ELK stack compatible)
- Real-time log streaming with filtering
- Log security and PII scrubbing
- Configurable log levels and retention policies

#### 4. Component Integration Complexity
**Risk:** Existing components like `FeatureDashboard` have complex state management
**Impact:** Integration may require significant refactoring
**Mitigation:** Gradual migration strategy with adapter layers
