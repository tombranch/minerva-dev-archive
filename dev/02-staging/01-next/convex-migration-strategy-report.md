# Convex + Clerk Migration Strategy Report

## Executive Summary

**Current Status**: Minerva Machine Safety Photo Organizer at 87% completion with Supabase + Next.js 15
**Recommendation**: Parallel development strategy - deploy current system to beta while building new features on Convex + Clerk
**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks to full migration with minimal disruption to beta launch

## Migration Rationale

### Current Pain Points with Supabase Stack
- **Type Safety Issues**: Frequent TypeScript errors with generated types getting out of sync
- **Schema Management**: Database schema lives outside codebase, limiting Claude Code effectiveness
- **Security Complexity**: 18+ RLS policies that are hard to audit and debug
- **Development Friction**: Context switching between dashboard and code for schema changes

### Convex + Clerk Benefits
- **End-to-end Type Safety**: Schema defines types automatically, no generation lag
- **Schema-in-Code**: Perfect for Claude Code development - AI can see entire data model
- **Built-in File Storage**: No external storage service needed (10GB free, $0.20/GB after)
- **Simplified Security**: Function-level auth instead of complex RLS policies
- **Real-time by Default**: Perfect for photo upload progress and AI processing status

## Recommended Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Development (Weeks 1-2)
**Objective**: Test Convex + Clerk with new feature development

#### Setup New Stack
```typescript
// convex/schema.ts - Start with isolated feature
export const aiModels = defineTable({
  name: v.string(),
  version: v.string(),
  performance_metrics: v.object({
    accuracy: v.number(),
    confidence_threshold: v.number(),
  }),
  organization_id: v.string(),
  created_by: v.string(), // Clerk user ID
});
```

#### Recommended First Feature: AI Model Management
- **Why**: Isolated from existing photo system
- **Scope**: Model selection, performance tracking, configuration
- **Benefits**: Tests real-time updates, auth integration, type safety

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Convex project setup with Clerk auth
- [ ] AI Model Management feature (MVP)
- [ ] Claude Code integration validation
- [ ] Performance and type safety comparison

### Phase 2: Beta Deployment (Week 1, parallel to Phase 1)
**Objective**: Launch current Supabase system to closed beta

#### Pre-deployment Checklist
- [ ] Fix critical TypeScript errors in current system
- [ ] Validate core workflows (upload, tagging, search)
- [ ] Set up production monitoring
- [ ] Document known issues for post-beta fixes

#### Beta Goals
- Validate product-market fit with machine safety engineers
- Generate initial user feedback and feature requests
- Establish revenue stream to fund continued development
- Identify most critical missing features

### Phase 3: Gradual Migration (Weeks 3-6)
**Objective**: Migrate existing features to Convex + Clerk based on beta learnings

#### Migration Priority Order
1. **Photos & Storage** (Week 3)
   ```typescript
   // Convex schema for photos
   export const photos = defineTable({
     title: v.string(),
     storageId: v.id("_storage"), // Built-in Convex storage
     aiTags: v.array(v.string()),
     confidenceScores: v.object({
       machineType: v.number(),
       hazardType: v.number(),
     }),
     organizationId: v.string(),
     uploadedBy: v.string(),
   });
   ```

2. **AI Processing Pipeline** (Week 4)
   - Migrate Google Vision API integration
   - Implement batch processing with Convex actions
   - Real-time progress updates

3. **User & Organization Management** (Week 5)
   - Migrate to Clerk auth
   - Organization-level permissions
   - User profiles and project membership

4. **Search & Analytics** (Week 6)
   - Advanced search functionality
   - PostHog integration for analytics
   - Performance optimization

#### Data Migration Strategy
**Option A: Big Bang Migration**
- Schedule maintenance window
- Export all data from Supabase
- Import to Convex with transformation scripts
- Update DNS/deployment

**Option B: Gradual User Migration** (Recommended)
- New users automatically use Convex stack
- Existing users stay on Supabase initially
- Provide migration tool for users to move their data
- Sunset Supabase after 90% user migration

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Storage Migration
**Current**: Supabase Storage
**Future**: Convex built-in storage

```typescript
// Upload flow with Convex
export const generateUploadUrl = mutation({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (!identity) throw new Error("Unauthorized");
    return await ctx.storage.generateUploadUrl();
  },
});

// Store and process photo
export const storePhoto = mutation({
  args: { 
    storageId: v.id("_storage"),
    title: v.string(),
    organizationId: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (!identity) throw new Error("Unauthorized");
    
    const photoId = await ctx.db.insert("photos", {
      ...args,
      uploadedBy: identity.subject,
      uploadedAt: Date.now(),
    });
    
    // Trigger AI processing
    await ctx.scheduler.runAfter(0, internal.ai.processPhoto, {
      photoId,
    });
    
    return photoId;
  },
});
```

### Authentication Migration
**Current**: Supabase Auth with RLS policies
**Future**: Clerk + Convex function-level auth

```typescript
// Organization-level security (replaces RLS)
export const getOrganizationPhotos = query({
  args: { organizationId: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (!identity) return [];
    
    // Verify user has access to organization
    const membership = await ctx.db
      .query("organizationMembers")
      .withIndex("by_user_org", q => 
        q.eq("userId", identity.subject)
         .eq("organizationId", args.organizationId)
      )
      .first();
      
    if (!membership) throw new Error("Access denied");
    
    return await ctx.db
      .query("photos")
      .withIndex("by_organization", q => 
        q.eq("organizationId", args.organizationId)
      )
      .collect();
  },
});
```

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **Data Migration Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Photo files and metadata corruption during migration
   - **Mitigation**: Parallel systems during transition, comprehensive testing, rollback plan

2. **User Experience Disruption**
   - **Risk**: Users lose access or data during migration
   - **Mitigation**: Gradual migration, clear communication, user migration tools

3. **Learning Curve Delays**
   - **Risk**: New patterns slow development velocity
   - **Mitigation**: Start with small feature, extensive documentation, community support

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Vendor Lock-in**
   - **Risk**: Convex-specific patterns make future migration difficult
   - **Mitigation**: Abstract business logic, maintain data export capabilities

2. **Performance Unknowns**
   - **Risk**: Convex may not handle large file processing as efficiently
   - **Mitigation**: Performance testing during Phase 1, benchmarking against current system

- [ ] Deploy current Supabase system to beta
- [ ] Begin AI Model Management feature on new stack

### Week 2
- [ ] Complete AI Model Management MVP
- [ ] Gather beta user feedback
- [ ] Document Convex development experience improvements

### Week 3-4
- [ ] Migrate photo management to Convex
- [ ] Parallel system testing
- [ ] User acceptance testing

### Week 5-6

## Recommendation

**Proceed with parallel development strategy**:

1. **Immediate**: Deploy current Supabase system to beta (this week)
2. **Parallel**: Build AI Model Management on Convex + Clerk (next 2 weeks)
3. **Evaluate**: Compare development experience and decide on full migration
4. **Migrate**: Gradual feature-by-feature migration based on beta learnings

This approach minimizes risk while maximizing the potential benefits of the new stack. The type safety and Claude Code integration improvements alone justify the migration effort, but the parallel approach ensures you don't delay critical business milestones.
