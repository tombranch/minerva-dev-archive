## Problem Statement & Goals

### Problem Statement

The current AI Features management system presents several critical usability and workflow challenges for AI engineers and developers:

1. **Complex Multi-Page Navigation:** Users must navigate between 5+ separate pages (features list, individual feature detail, models, prompts, testing, settings) to complete common tasks
2. **Scattered Dashboard Metrics:** Key performance metrics are split between the main features list and individual feature dashboards, requiring multiple page loads to get complete system health view
3. **Disconnected Testing Workflow:** Testing functionality is isolated from configuration settings, making iterative testing and debugging inefficient
4. **Missing Integrated Logging:** No unified access to logs and monitoring data within the feature management workflow
5. **Fragmented Configuration Management:** Settings are spread across multiple tabs without clear relationships between rate limits, costs, models, and prompts

### Primary Goals

1. **Unified Navigation Experience:** Create a single-page interface with sidebar navigation that eliminates complex page transitions
2. **Integrated Dashboard Analytics:** Combine feature overview with FeatureDashboard metrics in a single view
3. **Streamlined Testing Workflow:** Embed testing capabilities directly within configuration sections with real-time result display
4. **Centralized Monitoring Access:** Provide drawer-based access to logs and monitoring data from any configuration section
5. **Consolidated Settings Management:** Unify all configuration options (models, prompts, rate limits, cost controls, monitoring) in a single Settings tab

### Success Metrics

- **Navigation Efficiency:** 60% reduction in average page transitions per task completion
- **Task Completion Time:** 40% reduction in time to complete common AI management workflows
- **Developer Productivity:** 90% positive feedback on workflow efficiency improvements
- **Error Resolution Time:** 50% reduction in time to diagnose and resolve AI system issues through integrated testing and logging

```

### API Integration Strategy

#### Existing API Endpoints (Maintained)
- `GET /api/platform/ai-management/features` - Feature list with metrics
- `GET /api/platform/ai-management/features/{id}` - Individual feature details
- `PUT /api/platform/ai-management/features/{id}` - Feature configuration updates
- `GET /api/platform/ai-management/prompts` - Prompt management
- `POST /api/platform/ai-management/experiments` - A/B testing integration

#### New API Endpoints (Required)
- `GET /api/platform/ai-management/features/{id}/logs` - Real-time log streaming
- `POST /api/platform/ai-management/features/{id}/test` - Integrated testing endpoint
- `GET /api/platform/ai-management/features/{id}/metrics/stream` - WebSocket metrics
- `PUT /api/platform/ai-management/features/{id}/quick-actions` - Sidebar quick actions

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Testing
- Individual component functionality with mocked dependencies
- State management logic with various configuration scenarios
- API integration with mock responses and error conditions
- Real-time update mechanisms with simulated WebSocket events

#### Integration Testing
- Full workflow testing from feature selection through configuration and testing
- Cross-component communication and state synchronization
- API endpoint integration with real backend services
- Performance testing with realistic data volumes and concurrent users

#### User Acceptance Testing
- AI engineer workflow validation with real-world scenarios
- Interface usability testing with task completion time measurement
- Accessibility testing with keyboard navigation and screen readers
- Cross-browser compatibility testing on supported platforms

### Success Measurement Implementation

#### Analytics Events Tracking
```typescript
// Key user interaction events
- feature_selected: { featureId, fromSidebar: boolean }
- settings_section_opened: { featureId, section: string }
- test_executed: { featureId, testType: string, duration: number }
- configuration_saved: { featureId, changedSections: string[] }
- logs_accessed: { featureId, accessMethod: string }
- quick_action_used: { featureId, action: string }
```

#### Performance Metrics
- Page load time from navigation to fully interactive interface
- Feature switching time from sidebar selection to content display
- Test execution time from initiation to results display
- Log drawer opening time from click to first log entries
- Real-time update latency for metrics and status changes

#### User Workflow Analysis
- Task completion time measurement for common workflows
- Navigation pattern analysis to identify workflow inefficiencies
- Error rate tracking for configuration changes and testing
- Feature adoption rate measurement for new integrated capabilities

*This PRD serves as the comprehensive specification for the AI Features Management Interface Redesign. All development should align with these requirements, with particular attention to the integrated workflow approach that reduces navigation complexity while maintaining full functionality. The implementation should prioritize developer productivity and system reliability while ensuring seamless integration with existing Minerva platform capabilities.*
