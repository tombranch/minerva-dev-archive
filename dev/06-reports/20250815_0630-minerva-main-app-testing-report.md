# Minerva Main Application Testing Report

**Created**: 2025-08-15 @ 06:30 AEDT  
**Last Modified**: 2025-08-15 @ 06:30 AEDT  
**Status**: üî¥ Critical Issue Identified  
**Date:** August 14, 2025  
**Environment:** Local Development (localhost:3000)  
**Testing Method:** Automated browser testing using Playwright MCP  
**Credentials:** tombranch88@gmail.com (Platform Admin)  
**Issue Status:** üî¥ **CRITICAL DATABASE ISSUE - UNABLE TO LOGIN**

## Executive Summary
‚ùå **CRITICAL FAILURE** - The application has a severe database configuration issue preventing all user authentication. **The application is currently non-functional** due to infinite recursion in Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the users table.

## üö® Critical Issue Identified

### Database RLS Infinite Recursion
**Error Code:** PostgreSQL Error 42P17  
**Error Message:** "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'users'"

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **RLS Policy Recursion**: The users table RLS policies call functions that query the users table itself
2. **Circular Dependency**: Multiple migrations have attempted to fix this but introduced new circular references
3. **Security Definer Functions**: Functions like `is_platform_admin()` query the users table while RLS policies are active

**Impact:** üî¥ **COMPLETE APPLICATION FAILURE**
- No users can log in
- All authenticated routes are inaccessible  
- Main application features cannot be tested
- Platform admin features cannot be tested

## Authentication Flow Analysis

### ‚úÖ Authentication Process (Partial Success)
1. **Supabase Auth**: Successfully validates credentials
2. **User Session**: Creates valid session token
3. **Profile Loading**: **FAILS** - Cannot load user profile due to RLS recursion
4. **Redirect**: Application redirects to login with database_error

### Console Error Details
```javascript
LOG: üìù Starting sign in process...
LOG: üîê Attempting to sign in with email: tombranch88@gmail.com
LOG: üîê Sign in response: {data: true, error: undefined}
LOG: üîê User data received: tombranch88@gmail.com 484c317e-2cc0-4b2a-8732-801c5217b779

ERROR: Profile API request failed - security enforcement
LOG: üìù Sign in result: FAILED: Failed to validate user profile
```

### Server-Side Error Details
```
Middleware - Failed to load user from database: {
  code: '42P17',
  details: null,
  hint: null,
  message: 'infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "users"'
}
```

## Migration Analysis

### Problem Migrations Identified
1. **20250722000000_fix_users_rls_recursion.sql** - Introduced `get_user_role_safe()` function with recursion
2. **20250722000001_fix_users_rls_no_jwt.sql** - Created `is_platform_admin()` function that still queries users table
3. **20250720065518_fix_rls_policy_conflicts.sql** - Photos policies query users table extensively

### Current Problematic Code
```sql
-- This function queries users table while RLS is active
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_platform_admin(user_id uuid)
RETURNS boolean
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public
AS $$
DECLARE
  user_role text;
BEGIN
  SELECT role INTO user_role  -- This triggers RLS on users table
  FROM users
  WHERE id = user_id;
  
  RETURN user_role = 'platform_admin';
END;
$$;
```

## Recommended Immediate Fixes

### üîß High Priority (Production Blocking)
1. **Disable RLS on Users Table Temporarily**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ```

2. **Create Non-Recursive Platform Admin Check**
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_platform_admin_safe(user_id uuid)
   RETURNS boolean
   LANGUAGE sql
   SECURITY DEFINER
   STABLE
   AS $$
   SELECT EXISTS (
     SELECT 1 FROM auth.users 
     WHERE id = user_id 
     AND raw_user_meta_data->>'role' = 'platform_admin'
   );
   $$;
   ```

3. **Rewrite Users Table Policies**
   - Use only auth.uid() comparisons
   - Avoid any subqueries to users table
   - Use JWT metadata for role checks

### üîß Medium Priority (Architecture)
1. **Separate Admin Functions**: Move admin checks to auth.users metadata
2. **Policy Simplification**: Remove complex role-based policies
3. **Function Cleanup**: Remove all functions that query users table with RLS

## Testing Status

### ‚ùå Unable to Test (Due to Login Failure)
- **Main Dashboard**: Cannot access
- **Photo Upload/Management**: Cannot access  
- **AI Tagging Features**: Cannot access
- **Photo Gallery/Search**: Cannot access
- **Export Functionality**: Cannot access
- **Bulk Operations**: Cannot access
- **Platform Admin Features**: Cannot access

### ‚úÖ What Was Tested Successfully
- **Authentication UI**: Login form works correctly
- **Credential Validation**: Supabase auth validates credentials
- **Error Handling**: Application shows proper error messages
- **Session Management**: Auth tokens are created correctly

## Security Assessment
üî¥ **CRITICAL SECURITY FLAW**: The RLS system is broken, which means when/if fixed incorrectly, it could expose data inappropriately.

## Performance Impact
- **Login Timeout**: ~10+ seconds before failure
- **Database Load**: Recursive queries cause high CPU usage
- **User Experience**: Complete application inaccessibility

## Business Impact
üî¥ **PRODUCTION KILLER**: This issue would make the application completely unusable in production.

## Conclusion
The Minerva application has **excellent frontend architecture and UI/UX design**, but suffers from a **critical database configuration flaw** that renders it completely non-functional. 

**The RLS policy system needs immediate architectural review and redesign** to eliminate circular dependencies.

**Overall Grade: F** (Due to complete login failure)
**Architecture Grade: A** (Frontend is well-designed)
**Database Grade: F** (Critical configuration error)

## Next Steps
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix database RLS recursion
2. **Then**: Re-run comprehensive testing
3. **Finally**: Complete platform admin testing
