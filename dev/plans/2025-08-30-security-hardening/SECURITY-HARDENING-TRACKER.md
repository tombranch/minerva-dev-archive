## 🎯 **Next Actions**

### **Immediate (Today)**
1. 📋 **Review and approve planning documents** - Ensure comprehensive approach
2. 📋 **Create security hardening branch** - `git checkout -b security-hardening-fixes`
3. 📋 **Clear context if needed** - Use `/clear` before starting Session 1
4. 📋 **Begin Session 1** - Reference plan, update TodoWrite, start EXPLORE phase

### **This Week**
1. 📋 **Complete all 6 sessions** - 2-2.5 hour total implementation
2. 📋 **Conduct security audit** - Validate all vulnerabilities resolved
3. 📋 **Production deployment** - After security approval
4. 📋 **Update production review** - Mark all issues as resolved

## 📝 **Notes & Lessons Learned**

### **Planning Insights**
- Session-based approach ideal for security fixes requiring focused attention
- Clear session boundaries prevent context overflow on security-sensitive work
- Authorization framework (Session 1) enables efficient implementation in Sessions 2-3
- Testing infrastructure fix (Session 5) essential for validation of security changes

### **Key Decisions Made**
1. **Authorization Strategy**: Centralized helpers in convex/helpers.ts for reusability
2. **Session Prioritization**: Critical authorization bypasses addressed first (Sessions 1-3)
3. **Testing Approach**: Fix infrastructure first, then add security-specific tests
4. **Error Handling**: Generic secure messages with detailed internal logging
5. **Implementation Order**: Foundation → Core Vulnerabilities → Validation → Quality Assurance
