# Security Hardening Implementation Plans - Master Overview

**Created**: August 30, 2025  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive planning documentation for resolving critical security vulnerabilities  
**Status**: üìã **Ready for Implementation**  
**Implementation Time**: 2-2.5 hours across 6 focused sessions

---

## üéØ **Project Overview**

Following the comprehensive production review report dated August 30, 2025, this directory contains complete planning documentation to address **5 critical security vulnerabilities** that are blocking production deployment. The implementation uses Claude Code's proven session-based approach for efficient, focused security fixes.

### **Critical Issues Summary**
1. **Authorization Bypass** - Photos accessible across organization boundaries
2. **Export Data Breach** - Users can export other organizations' data  
3. **API Credential Exposure** - Google Cloud credentials insecurely processed
4. **Input Validation Gaps** - Insufficient file upload validation
5. **Testing Infrastructure Broken** - Cannot validate security implementations

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites** 
1. **Review Production Analysis**: Read the original review document:
   `/home/tom-branch/dev/projects/minerva/convex-feature-migration/dev/reviews/2025-08-30-convex-production-fixes-review.md`

2. **Development Environment**: 
   - pnpm configured and ready
   - Git repository clean and on correct branch
   - Environment variables properly set

3. **Context Preparation**:
   - Use `/clear` if switching from unrelated work
   - Have TodoWrite ready for session tracking
   - Reference these documents instead of repeating context

### **Implementation Workflow**

#### Step 1: Plan Approval
- [ ] Review all three planning documents
- [ ] Understand session-based approach  
- [ ] Confirm 2-2.5 hour time allocation
- [ ] Create security hardening branch: `git checkout -b security-hardening-fixes`

#### Step 2: Session Execution
- [ ] **Session 1** (20 min): Authorization Framework - Create helpers in `convex/helpers.ts`
- [ ] **Session 2** (20 min): Secure Core Functions - Fix `convex/photos.ts` authorization
- [ ] **Session 3** (20 min): Export Security - Secure `convex/export.ts` functions
- [ ] **Session 4** (20 min): Input Validation - File security and credential handling
- [ ] **Session 5** (15 min): Testing Infrastructure - Fix Vitest configuration
- [ ] **Session 6** (15 min): Error Handling - Final security audit

#### Step 3: Validation & Deployment
- [ ] Security audit confirms all vulnerabilities resolved
- [ ] Testing infrastructure validates implementations  
- [ ] Production deployment approved
- [ ] Update original review document with resolution status

## üìä **Success Metrics & Targets**

### **Security Coverage Improvements**
| Metric | Before | Target | Expected After |
|--------|--------|--------|----------------|
| Authorization Coverage | 40% | 100% | 100% |
| Input Validation Coverage | 30% | 95% | 95% |
| Error Security (No Info Disclosure) | 60% | 100% | 100% |
| Access Control (Organization Scoping) | 50% | 100% | 100% |

### **Production Readiness Score**
- **Current**: 78/100 (Production ready with critical fixes required)
- **Target**: 100/100 (Complete production excellence)
- **Blocking Issues**: 5 critical security vulnerabilities
- **Timeline**: 2-2.5 hours to resolution

## üß† **Session-Based Implementation Philosophy**

### **Why Session-Based Approach?**
1. **Focus**: 10-20 minute sessions maintain high concentration on security-critical work
2. **Context Efficiency**: Clear boundaries prevent token overflow on complex security fixes  
3. **Quality Gates**: Each session has commit points for rollback if needed
4. **Incremental Testing**: Validate security after each critical change
5. **Documentation**: Session-level tracking enables clear handoffs

### **Proven Success Pattern**
This approach has been validated through the original Convex production fixes implementation, which achieved:
- **Context Efficiency**: Used only 52% of available context budget
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each session had distinct, achievable objectives  
- **Quality Handoffs**: Clean commits between sessions with clear documentation
- **Focused Execution**: 10-20 minute sessions maintained high concentration

### **Context Management Protocol**
- **Between Sessions**: Use `/clear` and reference these documents
- **Within Sessions**: Follow EXPLORE ‚Üí PLAN ‚Üí CODE ‚Üí COMMIT structure
- **Documentation**: Update tracker after each session completion
- **Quality**: Test incrementally, don't wait until session end

## üîê **Security Implementation Priorities**

### **Phase 1: Critical Authorization (Sessions 1-3)**
**Objective**: Eliminate data access vulnerabilities
- Session 1: Create authorization framework
- Session 2: Secure photo access functions  
- Session 3: Secure data export functions
**Impact**: Prevents unauthorized cross-organization data access

### **Phase 2: Input Security (Session 4)**  
**Objective**: Prevent malicious input processing
- File upload validation and sanitization
- Secure API credential handling
- Input validation for AI processing pipeline
**Impact**: Prevents system compromise through malicious files

### **Phase 3: Quality Assurance (Sessions 5-6)**
**Objective**: Enable validation and finalize security
- Fix testing infrastructure for security validation
- Secure error handling (no information disclosure)
- Final comprehensive security audit
**Impact**: Ensures security implementations work correctly
