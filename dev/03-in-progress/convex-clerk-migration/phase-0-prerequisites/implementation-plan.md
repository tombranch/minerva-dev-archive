# Phase 0: Prerequisites & Setup - Implementation Plan

**Duration**: 1-2 days
**Responsible**: Human operator
**Objective**: Complete all account setup and environment configuration
**Success Criteria**: Development environment ready for Phase 1

---

## üéØ Phase Overview

Phase 0 is the foundation for the entire migration. All tasks require human intervention as they involve external service account creation, payment configuration, and environment setup. This phase must be completed before any development work can begin.

**Critical Dependencies**:
- GitHub account for Convex authentication
- Business email for Clerk account
- Credit card for production scaling (optional initially)
- Access to current environment variables

     - ‚úÖ Google OAuth (recommended)
     - ‚úÖ Microsoft OAuth (if organization uses Office 365)

3. **Application Configuration**
   - **Development Environment**:
     - Add domain: `localhost:3000`
     - Set redirect URLs: `http://localhost:3000`
   - **Production Environment** (for later):
     - Add production domain when ready
     - Configure SSL/HTTPS redirects

4. **Organization Support Setup**
   - Navigate to "Organizations" in dashboard
   - Enable organization support
   - Configure organization creation settings:
     - Allow users to create organizations: Yes
     - Max organizations per user: 3 (adjust as needed)

5. **API Keys Collection**
   - Go to "API Keys" section
   - Copy the following (store securely):
     - **Publishable Key**: `pk_test_...` (safe for frontend)
     - **Secret Key**: `sk_test_...` (server-side only)
   - Go to "Webhooks" section (for later)
     - Note webhook signing key format: `whsec_...`

**Verification Checklist**:
- [ ] Can access Clerk dashboard at dashboard.clerk.com
- [ ] Application "Minerva Machine Safety" created
- [ ] All authentication providers configured
- [ ] Organization support enabled
- [ ] Development domain (localhost:3000) added
- [ ] All API keys available and saved securely

**Output Required**:
- **Publishable Key**: `pk_test_...`
- **Secret Key**: `sk_test_...`
- **Application ID**: For reference
- **Webhook Signing Key**: `whsec_...` (for later phases)

### Task 3: Environment Variable Configuration
**Timeline**: 15 minutes
**Priority**: P1 - Required for development startup

**File Creation**:

Create `.env.local` in project root:
```bash
# Convex Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL="https://your-project-id.convex.cloud"

# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_your_key_here"
CLERK_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_your_secret_key_here"
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_your_webhook_secret_here"

# Existing Integrations (Keep for Phases 4-5)
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/service-account.json"
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID="your-existing-project-id"

# Analytics (Keep existing)
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY="your-existing-posthog-key"

# Development Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV="development"
```

**Security Setup**:
1. Verify `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
2. Never commit these files to git
3. Store production keys separately for later

**Verification Steps**:
1. Run `npm run dev:safe` from project root
2. Check browser console for environment variable errors
3. Verify no CORS or authentication errors
4. Test that both Convex and Clerk can be reached

**Verification Checklist**:
- [ ] `.env.local` file created with all required variables
- [ ] All keys are properly formatted (no extra quotes/spaces)
- [ ] Environment file not committed to git
- [ ] Development server starts without environment errors
- [ ] Browser console shows no authentication/CORS errors

---

## üîç Integration Verification

### Final Integration Test
**Timeline**: 10 minutes
**Objective**: Ensure both services are accessible and configured correctly

**Steps**:
1. Start development server: `npm run dev:safe`
2. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Check browser developer console:
   - No CORS errors from convex.cloud domain
   - No authentication errors from clerk.com domain
   - All environment variables loading correctly

**Success Indicators**:
- ‚úÖ Development server starts successfully
- ‚úÖ No environment variable errors in terminal
- ‚úÖ No CORS errors in browser console
- ‚úÖ Can access both Convex and Clerk dashboards
- ‚úÖ Ready to begin Phase 1 development

**Troubleshooting Checklist**:
- [ ] If Convex URL not working: Ensure project is created and URL is correct
- [ ] If Clerk keys invalid: Regenerate keys and check format
- [ ] If CORS errors: Verify localhost:3000 is added to Clerk domains
- [ ] If environment vars not loading: Restart dev server after changes
