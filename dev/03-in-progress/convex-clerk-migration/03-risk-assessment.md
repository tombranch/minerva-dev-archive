## 🚨 HIGH RISK ITEMS

### 1. Complex Data Schema Migration (Phase 3)
**Risk Level**: HIGH 🔴
**Probability**: 60%
**Timeline Impact**: +1-2 weeks
**Business Impact**: Could delay photo functionality

**Description**: Convex schema design may be more complex than anticipated, especially for:
- Multi-tenant photo organization structure
- Metadata and tagging relationships
- File storage references and indexing
- Search optimization requirements

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Schema design taking >3 days in Phase 1
- Complex relationship modeling issues
- Performance concerns in initial tests
- Difficulty with Convex query patterns

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- ✅ **Prototype Early**: Build schema proof-of-concept in Phase 1
- ✅ **Context7 Research**: Deep dive into Convex schema docs before Phase 3
- ✅ **Expert Consultation**: Engage Convex support if needed
- ✅ **Incremental Approach**: Migrate simple tables first
- ✅ **Fallback Plan**: Keep Supabase schema as reference

**Contingency Plan**:
If schema migration becomes too complex:
1. Simplify initial schema (reduce relationships)
2. Implement missing features in later phases
3. Consider hybrid approach (Convex + external DB)
4. Extend timeline with stakeholder approval

### 2. AI Processing Performance (Phase 4)
**Risk Level**: HIGH 🔴
**Probability**: 40%
**Timeline Impact**: +1-2 weeks
**Business Impact**: Core feature performance degradation

**Description**: Convex actions may not perform as well as current server-side AI processing:

- Large image processing memory usage
- Batch processing throughput limitations
- Real-time progress update overhead

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Action timeouts during testing
- Memory usage exceeding limits
- Slow batch processing speeds
- Real-time updates causing performance issues

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- ✅ **Performance Testing**: Benchmark early and often
- ✅ **Optimize Images**: Implement client-side compression
- ✅ **Chunked Processing**: Break large batches into smaller chunks
- ✅ **Caching Strategy**: Cache processed results aggressively
- ✅ **Alternative Approaches**: Research Convex performance patterns

**Contingency Plan**:
If performance is inadequate:
1. Optimize image sizes and formats
2. Implement more aggressive caching
3. Consider external processing service
4. Hybrid approach: Convex for metadata, external for processing

### 3. Real-time Implementation Complexity (Phase 4-5)
**Risk Level**: HIGH 🔴
**Probability**: 50%
**Timeline Impact**: +3-5 days
**Business Impact**: Missing real-time features

**Description**: Real-time features may be more complex to implement than expected:
- Complex state synchronization
- Race conditions in concurrent updates
- Real-time progress tracking accuracy
- Client-side state management complexity

**Early Warning Signs**:
- State synchronization bugs
- Progress tracking inaccuracies
- Performance degradation with many concurrent users
- Complex client-side state logic

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- ✅ **Start Simple**: Implement basic real-time first
- ✅ **Incremental Complexity**: Add advanced features gradually
- ✅ **State Management**: Use proven patterns (Zustand + Convex)
- ✅ **Testing**: Extensive testing with concurrent scenarios
- ✅ **Documentation**: Study Convex real-time best practices

**Contingency Plan**:
If real-time proves too complex:
1. Implement polling as fallback
2. Simplify real-time features for MVP
3. Add advanced real-time in post-launch phases
4. Focus on core functionality first
