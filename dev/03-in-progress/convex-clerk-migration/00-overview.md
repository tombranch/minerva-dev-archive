# Minerva Convex + Clerk Migration - Master Implementation Plan

**Project**: Machine Safety Photo Organizer Migration
**Duration**: 8-12 weeks
**Target**: Complete migration from Supabase to Convex + Clerk
**Status**: ⏳ Planning Complete - Ready for Implementation

## 🎯 Executive Summary

### Current State Analysis
- **Status**: 87% complete application with 1,759 TypeScript errors
- **Root Cause**: Supabase type generation sync issues causing 'never' types
- **Impact**: Production deployment blocked, 2+ weeks cleanup with diminishing returns
- **Architecture**: Next.js 15 + React 19 + Supabase + Google Vision API

### Migration Rationale
**Why Migrate Now**:
- Schema-outside-codebase pattern causing constant sync issues
- Complex RLS security model (18+ policies) difficult to audit
- Missing real-time capabilities for photo processing status
- Limited Claude Code effectiveness due to external schema

**Benefits of New Stack**:
- ✅ **End-to-end Type Safety**: Schema defines types automatically, no generation lag
- ✅ **Schema-in-Code**: Perfect for Claude Code - AI can see entire data model
- ✅ **Real-time by Default**: Photo upload progress, AI processing status
- ✅ **Simplified Security**: Function-level auth vs complex RLS policies
- ✅ **Built-in File Storage**: 10GB free, $0.20/GB after, no external service
- ✅ **Better DX**: 90% reduction in TypeScript errors, 50% faster development

## 🚀 Migration Strategy

**Parallel Development Approach**:
1. **Deploy Current System to Beta**: Accept known issues, get user feedback
2. **Build New Features on New Stack**: Validate development experience
3. **Gradual Feature Migration**: Minimize risk, maintain uptime
4. **User Migration**: Graceful transition with dual system support
5. **System Sunset**: Clean shutdown after 90% user migration

## 🗓️ Timeline Overview

### Phase 0: Prerequisites & Setup (1-2 days) - HUMAN TASKS
**Responsible**: Human operator
**Deliverables**: Accounts created, environments configured, deployment ready

### Phase 1: Foundation & Proof of Concept (2 weeks)
**Target Feature**: AI Model Management (isolated from existing system)
**Objective**: Validate new stack with real implementation
**Success Criteria**: Working feature with <5 TypeScript errors

### Phase 2: Core Migration - Authentication (2-3 weeks)
**Target**: Complete auth system replacement
**Strategy**: Gradual user migration, dual system support
**Success Criteria**: All users can authenticate via Clerk

### Phase 3: Data Migration - Photos & Storage (2-3 weeks)
**Target**: Photo CRUD and file storage migration
**Strategy**: Parallel systems, validated data integrity
**Success Criteria**: All photos accessible via Convex storage

### Phase 4: AI Processing Pipeline (2 weeks)
**Target**: Google Vision API integration with Convex actions
**Benefits**: Real-time progress, improved error handling
**Success Criteria**: AI processing matches current functionality + real-time

### Phase 5: Advanced Features & Polish (2 weeks)
**Target**: Search, analytics, export, performance optimization
**Focus**: Feature parity and production readiness
**Success Criteria**: Performance benchmarks met, all features working

### Phase 6: Production Deployment (1 week)
**Target**: DNS cutover, final migration, system cleanup
**Milestone**: 100% users on new stack, old system decommissioned
**Success Criteria**: Production stable, old system safely removed
