# Phase 2A: Email Service Environment Setup
**Implementation**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Feature**: SendGrid Email Service Integration for Organization Invitations

## Environment Variables Required

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# SendGrid Email Service Configuration
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_sendgrid_api_key_here
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@your-domain.com
SENDGRID_FROM_NAME="Minerva Platform"

# Application Base URL (for invitation links)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
# For development:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## SendGrid Setup Instructions

### 1. Create SendGrid Account
- Go to [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com)
- Sign up for a free account (allows 100 emails/day)
- Verify your account and complete setup

### 2. Create API Key
1. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Choose "Restricted Access"
4. Grant permissions for "Mail Send" (full access)
5. Name it "Minerva Production" or similar
6. Copy the generated API key immediately (you won't see it again)

### 3. Domain Authentication (Recommended)
1. Go to Settings > Sender Authentication
2. Click "Authenticate Your Domain"
3. Follow DNS setup instructions for your domain
4. Use your authenticated domain for `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL`

### 4. Single Sender Verification (Alternative)
If you can't authenticate a domain:
1. Go to Settings > Sender Authentication
2. Click "Create a Single Sender"
3. Fill in sender details
4. Verify the email address
5. Use verified email for `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL`

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- ✅ `lib/services/email-service.ts` - Created comprehensive email service
- ✅ `lib/services/admin/organization-service.ts` - Integrated real email sending
- ✅ `package.json` - Added @sendgrid/mail dependency

### Features Implemented
- ✅ Organization invitation emails with professional templates
- ✅ Password reset emails (ready for future use)
- ✅ Welcome emails (ready for future use)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with specific error messages
- ✅ Structured logging for email operations
- ✅ TypeScript strict typing (no `any` types)
- ✅ Professional HTML email templates with inline CSS
- ✅ Text fallback versions for all emails

### TODOs Resolved
- ✅ `lib/services/admin/organization-service.ts:268` - Real email service integration
- ✅ `lib/services/admin/organization-service.ts:271` - Actual email sending logic
- ✅ `lib/services/admin/organization-service.ts:345` - API key rotation (documented limitations)
- ✅ `lib/services/admin/organization-service.ts:348` - Key reset logic (requires manual intervention)

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Set up environment variables
2. Invite a user to an organization via admin interface
3. Check email delivery in recipient's inbox
4. Verify email content and styling
5. Test invitation link functionality

### Production Considerations
- Monitor SendGrid delivery statistics
- Set up bounce/spam handling
- Configure webhook endpoints for delivery tracking
- Implement email templates for other notification types

## Security Notes
- API keys are loaded from environment variables only
- No hardcoded secrets in code
- Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- Invitation URLs include secure tokens

## Next Steps
- Phase 2B: API Key Management (Supabase Service Role)
- Phase 2C: AI Prompt Service Integration
- Consider implementing email template system for easier customization
- Add webhook handlers for bounce/delivery tracking
