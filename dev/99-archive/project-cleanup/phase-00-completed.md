# Phase 00 – Quick Wins: COMPLETED ✅

## Summary
Successfully fixed the single TypeScript error and formatting issues to reduce noise before parallel work.

## Changes Made

### TypeScript Error Fix
- **File**: components/ai/console/LiveStatus/LiveStatus.tsx
- **Issue**: TS2322 - Property 'refreshTrigger' does not exist on type 'SystemHealthProps'
- **Fix**: Removed `refreshTrigger={refreshTrigger}` prop from `<SystemHealth>` usage
- **Rationale**: SystemHealth component already has its own refresh mechanism and doesn't accept this prop

### Formatting Fix
- **Command**: `npm run format`
- **Result**: Fixed formatting in 9 files that had Prettier violations
- **Files affected**: InteractiveAnalytics.tsx, AIManagementSidebar.tsx, LiveStatus components, shared hooks, etc.

## Validation Results
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: `npx tsc -p tsconfig.production.json --noEmit` - PASSED
- ✅ Formatting check: `npm run format:check` - PASSED  
- ✅ LiveStatus ESLint: `npx eslint components/ai/console/LiveStatus --max-warnings=0` - PASSED

The foundation is now clean for the parallel phases to execute without conflicts.
