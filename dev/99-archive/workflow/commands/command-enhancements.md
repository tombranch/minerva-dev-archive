# Command Enhancements - Context Passing & Workflow State Management

## Overview

This document specifies enhancements to existing slash commands to enable context passing between agents, workflow state management, and improved coordination.

## Core Enhancement Features

### 1. Workflow State Management

#### Workflow State File: `.claude/workflow-state.json`
```json
{
  "currentFeature": {
    "name": "advanced-photo-search",
    "description": "AI-powered photo search with advanced filtering",
    "prdPath": "dev/planning/feature-prds/advanced-photo-search-prd.md",
    "branch": "feature/advanced-photo-search",
    "status": "in_progress",
    "createdAt": "2025-08-01T10:30:00Z",
    "lastUpdated": "2025-08-01T15:45:00Z"
  },
  "agentContext": {
    "lastAgent": "architecture-reviewer",
    "previousOutputs": [
      {
        "agent": "prd-writer",
        "timestamp": "2025-08-01T10:30:00Z",
        "output": "PRD created with 8 user stories, 3 technical constraints",
        "artifacts": ["dev/planning/feature-prds/advanced-photo-search-prd.md"]
      }
    ],
    "sharedContext": {
      "technicalDecisions": ["Use Supabase full-text search", "Implement client-side filtering"],
      "constraints": ["Must maintain <500ms response time", "Support 10k+ photos"],
      "dependencies": ["Google Cloud Vision API", "Existing photo tagging system"]
    }
  },
  "qualityGates": {
    "passed": ["requirements-complete", "architecture-reviewed"],
    "pending": ["implementation-complete", "testing-complete", "security-reviewed"],
    "failed": []
  },
  "metrics": {
    "startTime": "2025-08-01T10:30:00Z",
    "estimatedCompletion": "2025-08-01T18:00:00Z",
    "actualEffort": "5.25 hours",
    "agentsUsed": ["prd-writer", "architecture-reviewer"]
  }
}
```

#### State Management Functions
```bash
# Initialize workflow state (called by /prd command)
initializeWorkflowState(featureName, description, prdPath)

# Update state with agent output
updateAgentContext(agentName, output, artifacts)

# Check quality gates
checkQualityGates(gate) → boolean

# Get current context for agent
getCurrentContext() → contextObject

# Complete workflow and archive state
completeWorkflow(success: boolean)
```

### 2. Context Passing Protocol

#### Agent Context Structure
```json
{
  "workflowContext": {
    "featureName": "string",
    "currentPhase": "planning|implementation|review|deployment",
    "prdReference": "path/to/prd.md",
    "technicalDecisions": ["array of decisions"],
    "qualityRequirements": ["array of requirements"]
  },
  "previousAgentOutputs": [
    {
      "agent": "string",
      "phase": "string", 
      "key_findings": ["array"],
      "recommendations": ["array"],
      "artifacts_created": ["paths"],
      "next_steps": ["array"]
    }
  ],
  "currentTask": {
    "description": "string",
    "acceptance_criteria": ["array"],
    "constraints": ["array"]
  }
}
```

#### Context Injection Pattern
Each enhanced command will:
1. **Load current workflow state** from `.claude/workflow-state.json`
2. **Pass context to agents** via structured prompt injection
3. **Collect agent outputs** in standardized format
4. **Update workflow state** with agent results
5. **Prepare context for next agent** in the sequence

### 3. Enhanced Command Specifications

#### Enhanced `/feature` Command

**New Context-Aware Process:**
```bash
# 1. Load workflow state and PRD context
loadWorkflowState()
loadPRDContext(prdPath)

# 2. Architecture Planning with full context
architecture-reviewer agent receives:
- PRD requirements and constraints
- Previous technical decisions
- Existing system architecture context
- Quality requirements and performance targets

# 3. Each subsequent agent receives:
- All previous agent outputs
- Updated technical decisions
- Accumulated recommendations
- Current implementation status

# 4. Final state update
updateWorkflowState(phase: "implementation-complete")
checkQualityGates(["implementation", "testing", "documentation"])
```

**Agent Coordination Improvements:**
- **Sequential context passing** - Each agent builds on previous work
- **Conflict resolution** - Later agents can override/refine earlier decisions
- **Shared artifact tracking** - All agents know what files have been created/modified
- **Quality gate enforcement** - Agents must meet previous quality requirements

#### Enhanced `/review` Command

**New Script-Analysis Integration:**
```bash
# 1. Run validation scripts in parallel
runScripts([
  "npm run validate:all",
  "npm run lint", 
  "npm run format:check",
  "npm run test:ci",
  "npm run build"
])

# 2. Context-aware agent analysis
typescript-safety-validator receives:
- Script outputs (build errors, type issues)
- Current feature context from workflow state
- Previous agent recommendations
- PRD requirements for type safety validation

# 3. Consolidated recommendations
consolidateAgentOutputs()
updateWorkflowState(qualityGateResults)
generatePrioritizedActionPlan()
```

**Quality Gate Integration:**
- **Automated pass/fail determination** - Based on script results
- **Context-aware analysis** - Agents understand current feature scope
- **Historical trend tracking** - Compare current vs previous review results
- **Actionable recommendations** - Specific fixes tied to current workflow

#### Enhanced `/deploy` Command

**New Pre-Deployment Validation:**
```bash
# 1. Load workflow state and validate completeness
validateWorkflowState()
checkAllQualityGates()

# 2. Context-aware deployment validation
production-readiness-auditor receives:
- Complete feature context from workflow state
- All previous agent outputs and decisions
- PRD success criteria for validation
- Current deployment environment state

# 3. Deployment decision matrix
generateDeploymentScore()
identifyRisksAndMitigations()
createRollbackPlan()
```

**Deployment Safety Enhancements:**
- **PRD criteria validation** - Ensure all requirements met before deployment
- **Agent consensus requirement** - Multiple agents must approve deployment
- **Automated rollback triggers** - Pre-defined conditions for automatic rollback
- **Deployment metrics tracking** - Success rates and performance impact

### 4. Cross-Command Integration

#### PRD → Feature → Review → Deploy Flow
```bash
# 1. /prd command creates workflow state
/prd advanced search functionality
→ Creates: workflow-state.json, dev/prds/active/advanced-search-prd.md, todo list

# 2. /feature command consumes PRD context  
/feature advanced search functionality
→ Reads: workflow-state.json, dev/prds/active/advanced-search-prd.md
→ Creates: dev/implementation/current/advanced-search/
→ Updates: implementation status, agent outputs

# 3. /review command validates against PRD criteria
/review
→ Reads: workflow-state.json, dev/prds/active/advanced-search-prd.md
→ Validates: implementation meets requirements
→ Updates: quality gate status

# 4. /deploy command requires PRD completion
/deploy --check-only
→ Reads: workflow-state.json, all quality gates
→ Validates: PRD criteria met, all gates passed
→ Creates: dev/completion-reports/feature-reports/advanced-search-report.md
→ Decision: ready/not-ready for deployment
```

#### Workflow State Transitions
```
INITIALIZED (prd) → PLANNING (feature) → IMPLEMENTING (feature) → 
TESTING (review) → READY (deploy) → DEPLOYED (deploy) → ARCHIVED
```

### 5. Quality Gates System

#### Automated Quality Gates
```json
{
  "gates": {
    "requirements-complete": {
      "validator": "prd-writer",
      "criteria": ["All user stories defined", "Acceptance criteria clear", "Success metrics defined"],
      "required_for": ["implementation"]
    },
    "architecture-reviewed": {
      "validator": "architecture-reviewer", 
      "criteria": ["Technical approach approved", "Integration points identified", "Performance impact assessed"],
      "required_for": ["implementation"]
    },
    "implementation-complete": {
      "validator": "code-writer",
      "criteria": ["All features implemented", "Error handling complete", "Tests written"],
      "required_for": ["review"]
    },
    "quality-validated": {
      "validator": "quality-assurance-specialist",
      "criteria": ["Code quality standards met", "Tests passing", "No critical issues"],
      "required_for": ["deployment"]
    },
    "security-approved": {
      "validator": "security-auditor",
      "criteria": ["No security vulnerabilities", "Authentication working", "Data protection verified"],
      "required_for": ["deployment"]
    },
    "production-ready": {
      "validator": "production-readiness-auditor",
      "criteria": ["All quality gates passed", "Documentation complete", "Monitoring configured"],
      "required_for": ["deployment"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Gate Enforcement Rules
- **Sequential dependencies** - Later gates require earlier gates to pass
- **Agent accountability** - Each gate has a responsible agent validator
- **Automatic checking** - Gates checked automatically at transition points
- **Override capability** - Manual override with justification for emergency situations
