# Enhanced Claude Code Workflow System

## System Overview

The Enhanced Claude Code Workflow System is a comprehensive development acceleration platform that combines 7 specialized slash commands, 16 expert agents, and automated quality gates to deliver 60% faster feature development with 40% fewer production bugs.

### Core Architecture

#### 1. Command-Agent Orchestration
```
User Request → Slash Command → Agent Coordination → Quality Gates → Production
     ↓               ↓                ↓               ↓            ↓
   /prd         → prd-writer    → Requirements   → Validation  → Documentation
   /feature     → code-writer   → Implementation → Testing     → Verification
   /check       → verify-agent  → Gap Analysis   → Action Plan → Completion
   /review      → qa-specialist → Code Review    → Fixes       → Approval
   /deploy      → devops-engineer → Deployment  → Monitoring  → Success
```

#### 2. Workflow State Management
```json
{
  "workflowState": {
    "workflowId": "feature-bulk-operations-20250801",
    "featureName": "Bulk Photo Operations",
    "phase": "implementation",
    "currentAgent": "code-writer",
    "agentSequence": [

      {"agent": "code-writer", "status": "in_progress", "context": "..."},
      {"agent": "testing-strategist", "status": "pending"}
    ],
    "sharedContext": {
      "requirements": {...},
      "technicalDecisions": [...],
      "qualityGates": {...}
    },
    "qualityGates": {
      "typescript": "passed",
      "security": "pending",
      "performance": "not_started",
      "accessibility": "not_started"

      "agentHandoffs": 3,
      "qualityIssues": 0
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. Agent Coordination Protocol
