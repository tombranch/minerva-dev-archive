# Gap to MVP – Phased Implementation Plans

This folder contains phased, task-oriented implementation plans to close the final gaps to MVP. Each phase is small enough for an individual agent to implement independently.

Phases
- Phase 1: Organization Context Hardening
- Phase 2: AI & Analytics Endpoint Security Standardization
- Phase 3: CI Quality Gates and Lint/Type Remediation
- Phase 4: Production Hygiene (Dev Utils, Dead/Duplicate Code)
- Phase 5: Tests & E2E Coverage (Platform Admin)
- Phase 6: Documentation & Ops Readiness

Supporting docs
- prd.md – Problem, goals, success metrics
- plan.md – Overall implementation plan
- status.md – Tracking & checklist
- acceptance-checklist.md – Final acceptance criteria
- agents/ – Optional role-based briefs (if useful)
