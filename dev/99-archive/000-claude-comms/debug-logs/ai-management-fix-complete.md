# AI Management Frontend Integration - Fix Complete

## Issue Resolved ✅

**Problem**: The `Deploy` icon import from lucide-react was causing a build error.

**Solution**: Replaced `Deploy` with `Rocket` icon in the ActivityFeed component.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed Import Error**:
   - Changed `Deploy` to `Rocket` in ActivityFeed.tsx imports
   - Updated all usages of `Deploy` icon to `Rocket`

2. **Implementation Status**:
   - ✅ All 6 new AI management routes created
   - ✅ Navigation sidebar updated with new views
   - ✅ Main redirect updated to new Global Overview
   - ✅ Import errors resolved

## Available Routes

The following new routes are now accessible:

- `/platform/ai-management/overview` - Global Overview Dashboard
- `/platform/ai-management/features` - AI Features Management
- `/platform/ai-management/models` - Models & Providers
- `/platform/ai-management/prompts` - Prompt Library
- `/platform/ai-management/spending` - Spending Analytics
- `/platform/ai-management/experiments` - Testing & Experimentation

## Next Steps

1. **Test the routes** by navigating to `/platform/ai-management/`
2. **Verify navigation** between different views works
3. **Connect real data** from the existing API endpoints to replace placeholder content
4. **Test platform admin access control**

The frontend integration is now complete and should be functional. The platform UI will show the new feature-centric views instead of the old technical-centric ones.
