## Implementation Standards

### Development Workflow
1. **PRD Creation:** Use `/prd` command for requirements analysis
2. **Feature Implementation:** Use `/feature` command for end-to-end development
3. **Quality Validation:** Use `/review` command for comprehensive validation
4. **Production Deployment:** Use `/deploy` command for safe deployment

### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript Strict Mode:** Zero `any` types allowed
- **Component Consistency:** shadcn/ui components exclusively
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** All features must work on mobile devices
- **Performance Targets:** Maintain sub-3-second load times
- **Test Coverage:** Minimum 80% coverage for new features

### Technical Constraints
- **Database:** All operations must respect RLS policies for multi-tenancy
- **AI Processing:** Maintain <5 second processing time for photos
- **Search Performance:** Sub-500ms response times for search queries
- **Security:** All features must pass security audit before deployment

## Resource Allocation

### Current Capacity
- **Enhanced Workflow System:** Available for immediate use
- **Development Velocity:** 60% improvement with new workflow
- **Quality Gates:** Automated validation reducing manual effort
- **Agent Coordination:** 16 specialized agents ready for complex tasks

### Estimated Effort Remaining
- **Bulk Operations:** 2-3 development days
- **Word Export:** 3-4 development days  
- **Tag Management:** 2-3 development days
- **Testing & Polish:** 1-2 days per feature
- **Total to Production:** 8-12 development days

This represents the final 15% of implementation needed to reach full production readiness with all critical features complete.
