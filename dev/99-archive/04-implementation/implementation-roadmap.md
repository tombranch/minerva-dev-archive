# Minerva Implementation Master Plan

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** July 13, 2025  
**Target Completion:** August 5, 2025 (3 weeks)  
**Project Status:** 85-90% Complete ‚Üí Production Ready

---

## üìã Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive implementation plan to complete the remaining 10-15% of the Minerva Machine Safety Photo Organizer and achieve production readiness. The work is organized into 4 focused chunks, each with detailed specifications, timelines, and deliverables.

**Total Estimated Effort:** 16-23 development days  
**Parallel Development Possible:** Yes, Chunks 1-3 can run in parallel  
**Critical Path:** Chunk 1 (Bulk Operations) ‚Üí Production Deployment

---

## üéØ Implementation Overview

### Completion Strategy

The remaining work is divided into **4 focused chunks** that address specific functional areas:

1. **üîß Chunk 1: Bulk Operations & Core UX** (Critical - 5-7 days)
2. **üìä Chunk 2: Export & Integration Features** (Critical - 4-6 days)  
3. **‚öôÔ∏è Chunk 3: Production Infrastructure** (High Priority - 3-4 days)
4. **üé® Chunk 4: Polish & Enhancement** (Medium Priority - 4-6 days)

### Development Approach

- **Parallel Development**: Chunks 1, 2, and 3 can be developed simultaneously
- **Incremental Testing**: Each chunk includes comprehensive testing requirements
- **Progressive Deployment**: Features can be deployed as chunks are completed
- **Quality Gates**: Each chunk has specific acceptance criteria
