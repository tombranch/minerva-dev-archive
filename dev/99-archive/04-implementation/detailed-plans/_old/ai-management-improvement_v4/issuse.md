● I'll analyze the AI management improvement planning documents and create a comprehensive implementation plan using the specialized agents. Let me first examine the current planning       
  materials.

● Search(pattern: "CREATE TABLE", path: "supabase\migrations", glob: "*ai*.sql", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 41 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the current state and the requirements. Based on my analysis of the planning documents and existing codebase, I can see that:

  1. Current Problems: The AI management system is scattered across /platform/costs, /platform/analytics, /platform/debug/ai*, /platform/settings/ai-management, and the main AI
  console, making it technical-centric rather than feature-centric.
  2. Desired Solution: Transform to a 6-view feature-centric system focused on AI capabilities (Photo Tagging, Chatbot, AI Search) rather than technical concerns.
  3. Existing Infrastructure: There are already comprehensive AI tables, components, and a solid foundation to build upon.

  Now I'll create a comprehensive implementation plan using the specialized agents to execute this transformation.

  ⎿ Platform AI Management System Redesign - Implementation Plan

    Executive Summary

    Complete redesign of the platform AI management system from technical-centric to feature-centric architecture focused on optimizing AI features (Photo Tagging, Chatbot, AI Search)

      - Create feature-centric data models supporting all 6 views
      - Plan data migration from scattered systems
      - Implement proper indexing and performance optimization
    3. API Architecture
      - Design RESTful API structure: /api/ai-management/[feature]/[...params]
      - Create unified endpoints replacing scattered APIs
