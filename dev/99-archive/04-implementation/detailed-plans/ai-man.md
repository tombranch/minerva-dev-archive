Design Brief: AI Feature Management Dashboard (Platform Admin/Developer Tool)

⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is a PLATFORM ADMIN/DEVELOPER TOOL, NOT an end-user feature!

1. Project Goal
Design and develop an intuitive, feature-centric AI management dashboard specifically for PLATFORM ADMINISTRATORS, DEVELOPERS, and AI ENGINEERS. This is an internal administrative tool for managing the AI infrastructure that powers the Minerva application. The primary objective is to provide platform team members with a seamless interface for managing the AI capabilities that end users consume (photo tagging/descriptions, chatbot, AI search).

**LOCATION**: This should be implemented in the platform admin area (/platform/ai-management), NOT in the main user application.

**ACCESS CONTROL**: Only platform administrators and authorized technical team members should have access.

2. Target Users
Primary Users: 
- Platform Administrators (managing AI infrastructure)
- Internal AI/ML Engineers (model deployment and optimization)
- DevOps Engineers (monitoring AI system health)
- Prompt Engineers (prompt optimization and testing)
- Product Managers overseeing AI features (analytics and insights)
- Finance/Business Analysts (cost monitoring and budget control)

**NOT FOR**: End users, regular organization admins, or photo management users

User Needs (derived from "Yes to all" and new requirements):

Direct Feature Management: Need to easily find and manage specific AI features (e.g., photo tagging's model/prompts).

Real-time Impact Visibility: Must see how changes to models or prompts directly affect the user-facing application.

Comparative Analysis: Require the ability to compare different AI models and their outputs side-by-side.

Auditability: A clear, robust audit trail for all changes made to models, prompts, providers, and configurations is essential.

Collaborative Prompting: Need tools to facilitate collaboration on prompt creation and testing.

Integrated Workflow: Desire to consolidate model and prompt management within the dashboard, reducing reliance on external tools.

Efficient Task Flow: Tasks like updating prompts or managing provider configurations should be quick and require minimal steps.

Clear Feature-Setting Linkage: Settings and configurations must be clearly linked to their respective AI features.

Dedicated Testing: A critical need for a built-in, robust testing environment for models and prompts.

Provider & Model Control: Ability to easily add, configure, switch between, and manage various AI model providers and their specific models.

Spending Transparency & Control: Clear visualization of AI-related costs and mechanisms to control and optimize spending.

Intelligent Prompt Generation: Assistance from an AI to help craft, refine, and optimize prompts.

3. Key Features & Functionality
3.1. Feature-Centric Navigation
Primary Navigation: Organize the dashboard around the core AI features of the app (e.g., "Photo Tagging," "Chatbot," "AI Search").

Feature-Specific Dashboards: Each feature section should provide an overview of its active models, prompt configurations, performance metrics, and associated spending.

3.2. AI Model & Provider Management
Provider Configuration: Centralized management of different AI model providers (e.g., OpenAI, Google Cloud AI, custom internal models). This includes API key management, rate limits, and regional settings.

Model Repository (per provider and global): A comprehensive place to view, add, update, and deploy specific AI models offered by each configured provider, or custom models.

Model Selection & Activation: Easy toggling between different models for a given AI feature, with clear indication of the currently active model.

Version Control: Robust versioning for all models (including provider models and custom models), allowing rollbacks and comparisons.

Model Comparison View: Side-by-side comparison of model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, latency, cost per inference) and output examples across providers/models.

Deployment Workflow: Streamlined process for deploying models to different environments (staging, production) with clear status indicators.

3.3. Prompt Library & Management
Global & Feature-Specific Prompts: Support for a "global" prompt library for common prompts, alongside feature-specific prompt libraries.

Prompt Editor: An intuitive editor for creating, modifying, and organizing prompts.

Versioning: Comprehensive version control for prompts, allowing easy access to historical versions and diffs.

Tagging/Categorization: Ability to tag and categorize prompts for easy discoverability and filtering.

Collaboration Features: Tools for shared prompt editing, commenting, and approval workflows.

AI Assistant for Prompt Generation:

Prompt Scaffolding: Generate initial prompt structures based on user intent (e.g., "Summarize," "Translate," "Generate Creative Text").

Contextual Refinement: Suggest improvements or expansions to existing prompts based on desired output, tone, or audience.

Error Detection & Best Practices: Highlight potential issues (e.g., ambiguity, missing parameters) and suggest prompt engineering best practices.

Iterative Generation: Allow users to iteratively refine prompts with the assistant's help, seeing real-time suggestions.

Prompt Templates: Provide a library of AI-generated or community-contributed prompt templates.

3.4. Comprehensive Testing & Experimentation
Prompt Testing Playground: A dedicated "sandbox" environment to test prompts against various inputs (user-defined or pre-defined datasets) and selected models, without affecting the live application.

Model Testing Suite: Functionality to run specific models against test datasets, evaluating outputs and performance, with the ability to switch models on the fly for comparative testing.

A/B Testing Integration: Tools to set up and monitor A/B tests for different models or prompt versions in a controlled environment.

Performance Monitoring: Real-time visualization of model and prompt performance metrics (e.g., response time, error rates, output quality) for both live and test environments.

Output Visualization: Clear and intuitive display of model and prompt outputs for easy evaluation, potentially including side-by-side comparisons of different model/prompt combinations.

3.5. Spending Visualization & Control
Real-time Cost Dashboard: Clear, interactive dashboards visualizing AI spending per provider, per model, per feature, and over time.

Budget Alerts: Configurable alerts for spending thresholds (daily, weekly, monthly).

Cost Optimization Insights: Suggestions or reports on potential cost savings, e.g., identifying cheaper equivalent models or less efficient prompt structures.

Usage Metrics: Track tokens consumed, API calls made, and other relevant usage data per model/feature.

3.6. Audit & Activity Logs
Comprehensive Change Log: A detailed, searchable audit trail of every modification (who, what, when, where) to models, prompts, provider configurations, and spending controls.

User Activity Dashboard: Overview of recent developer activities within the dashboard.

4. Technical Considerations (High-Level)

**IMPLEMENTATION LOCATION**:
- Route: `/app/platform/ai-management/` (under platform admin area)
- API Routes: `/app/api/platform/ai-management/` (platform admin API)
- Components: `/components/platform/ai-management/` (platform admin components)
- Access: Platform admin role required (`platform_admin` role in user_profiles table)

**SECURITY**:
- Must validate platform admin access on ALL routes
- Uses existing platform admin authentication system
- NO end-user access - this is infrastructure management only

**INTEGRATION**:
- API-Driven: Dashboard interacts with backend services and external AI provider APIs
- Scalability: Designed to handle growing AI infrastructure (models, prompts, providers)
- Role-Based Access Control: Platform admin roles and permissions
- Observability Integration: Connects to existing monitoring/logging systems

**RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING SYSTEMS**:
- This manages the AI infrastructure that powers end-user features
- End users consume AI features (photo tagging, chat, search) through regular app
- Platform admins use this tool to configure and optimize those AI capabilities

5. Success Metrics
Increased Developer Efficiency: Significantly reduced time and effort required for model deployment, prompt engineering, and feature management.

Optimized AI Spending: Demonstrable reduction in unnecessary AI infrastructure costs.

Improved Prompt Quality: Higher quality and more effective prompts leading to better AI application performance.

Faster Iteration Cycles: Quicker turnaround for testing and deploying new AI models and prompt variations.

Higher Developer Satisfaction: Positive feedback from developers regarding ease of use, intuitiveness, and overall utility.

Enhanced Visibility: Clear understanding of AI usage, performance, and costs across the organization.


Claude's Questions:
  1. Current Pain Points: The document mentions the current system is "non-feature-based and difficult to use." Looking at the current console, I see it has 4 areas (Live Status, Pipeline Control, Performance
  Analytics, Testing Lab). Are these the right organizational categories, or do you want to reorganize around the actual AI features (Photo Tagging, Chatbot, AI Search, etc.)?
  2. Primary Focus: Which of these developer workflows is most critical to improve first:
    - Feature-centric management (reorganizing around Photo Tagging, Chatbot, AI Search)
    - Advanced testing/experimentation capabilities
    - Cost optimization and spending controls
    - Model/provider management and comparison
    - Collaborative prompt engineering workflows
  3. Technical Depth: The current system seems quite technical already. Are you looking to:
    - Maintain the technical depth but improve organization/workflow
    - Simplify some areas while keeping advanced capabilities available
    - Add missing functionality (like the AI assistant for prompt generation)
  4. Integration Requirements: Should the improved console integrate with:
    - External prompt engineering tools
    - CI/CD pipelines for model deployment
    - Monitoring/alerting systems
    - Cost management platforms
  5. Scope Boundaries: Are we improving the existing 4 console areas, or completely redesigning the information architecture around the 6 key features mentioned (Feature-Centric Navigation, Model Management,
  Prompt Library, Testing, Spending, Audit)?

  Let me know your priorities and I'll create a comprehensive improvement plan focused on the platform engineering experience.


  Answers:
  1. sort of, but the AI features needs to be the top proirty
  2. optimizing the ai features to ensure the best outcomes for the end users
  3. maintain the depth, whilstsimplying the workflow and adding the feature. 
  4. not for now, but in the furture for sure
  5. i think we need to redesing the complete ai managemnt system. - there is also so overlap in the other platform admin tools, which could be consoldated i gues.
