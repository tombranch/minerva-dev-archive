1. Global Overview (Executive/Manager View)
This view provides a high-level summary, perfect for managers or anyone wanting a quick pulse check on the entire AI operation. It shouldn't get bogged down in technical details but offer actionable insights.

Key Information:

Overall AI Spending: Current month's spend, forecast, and comparisons to previous periods/budgets.

Feature Health Status: Quick indicators (e.g., green/yellow/red) for the status of critical AI features (Photo Tagging, Chatbot, AI Search), flagging any active issues or performance degradations.

Active Models & Providers: At-a-glance view of which primary models/providers are currently in use across the app.

Recent Activity Feed: A condensed log of significant changes (e.g., "Model X deployed to production," "Prompt Y updated by User Z").

Key Performance Metrics (KPIs): Summarized, high-level metrics like overall AI response time, error rate, or user engagement with AI features.

Interaction: Primarily for monitoring and quick navigation to problem areas or detailed views. Drill-down capabilities to Feature-Specific Dashboards or Spending Analytics.

2. Feature-Specific Dashboard (Developer/Feature Owner View)
This is the core workspace for your developers, allowing them to deep-dive into a particular AI capability. This view ensures a strong feature-based organization, addressing your initial pain point.

Key Information (Example: "Chatbot AI Feature"):

Active Model & Provider: Clearly shows which model and provider are currently powering the chatbot, with quick links to its configurations.

Prompt Library: Direct access to all prompts relevant to the chatbot, with search, filter, and versioning capabilities.

Performance Metrics: Real-time graphs and data on the chatbot's specific performance (e.g., average response time, user satisfaction scores, common queries, error rates).

Feature-Specific Spending: Cost breakdown specifically for the chatbot's AI usage.

Testing & Experimentation Hub: Direct access to the testing playground for this feature, allowing developers to test new prompts or model versions.

Recent Feature Changes: An audit log of changes made specifically to this AI feature's models, prompts, or configurations.

Interaction: Primary area for management, configuration, testing, and monitoring related to a single AI feature. Easy navigation between sub-sections like "Models," "Prompts," "Testing," and "Settings."

3. Model & Provider Management View (MLOps/Architect View)
This dedicated view focuses on the lifecycle and configuration of AI models and their underlying providers.

Key Information:

Provider List: A list of configured AI providers (e.g., OpenAI, Google Cloud AI, internal) with their status, API key management, and linked models.

Model Catalog: A comprehensive inventory of all available models (both external provider models and your custom models), including their versions, performance benchmarks, and associated costs per inference.

Model Deployment Pipelines: Visual representation of deployment status for models across different environments (dev, staging, production).

Model Comparison Tools: Interface for side-by-side comparison of different models' performance, cost, and outputs.

Resource Allocation: View of allocated resources (e.g., GPUs, memory) if managing custom/on-premise models.

Interaction: For adding new providers, managing API keys, uploading new model versions, configuring deployment pipelines, and performing detailed model performance analysis.

4. Prompt Library & AI Assistant View (Prompt Engineer/Developer View)
This is the central hub for prompt creation, management, and the integrated AI assistance.

Key Information:

Global Prompt Library: A searchable and filterable list of all prompts, allowing categorization by AI feature, type, or tags.

Prompt Editor: A rich text/code editor with syntax highlighting for prompt creation.

AI Assistant Integration: A dedicated sidebar or interactive panel where the AI assistant provides suggestions, refines prompts, checks for best practices, and generates variations.

Version History & Diff Tool: Clear display of prompt versions and a tool to compare changes between versions.

Testing Playground Link: Direct link to test the selected prompt instantly with various inputs and chosen models.

Collaboration Features: Commenting, sharing, and approval workflow tools for prompts.

Interaction: Primary area for prompt engineering, iterative refinement with AI assistance, version management, and collaboration.

5. Spending Analytics & Control View (Finance/Management/Business Analyst View)
A dedicated area for deep financial insights and cost optimization.

Key Information:

Cost Breakdown: Detailed charts and tables showing spending by provider, by model, by AI feature, and by time period (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly).

Budget Tracking: Set budgets and visualize current spend against budget with alert configurations.

Cost-per-Inference: Reports on the average cost for specific model inferences or API calls.

Usage Reports: Detailed logs of API calls, token consumption, and other relevant billing metrics.

Anomaly Detection: Highlighting unexpected spikes or dips in spending.

Optimization Recommendations: AI-driven suggestions for cost savings, such as recommending cheaper models for specific tasks or identifying underutilized resources.

Interaction: For monitoring costs, setting budgets, generating financial reports, and identifying areas for cost optimization.

6. Testing & Experimentation View (Developer/QA View)
A comprehensive environment for rigorous testing and A/B experimentation.

Key Information:

Test Case Management: Define and manage test cases (inputs, expected outputs) for models and prompts.

Execution Environment: Run tests against different models and prompt versions in a controlled sandbox.

Results Visualization: Clear display of test results, including actual vs. expected outputs, error logs, and performance metrics (e.g., latency, accuracy).

A/B Test Configuration: Set up and monitor ongoing A/B tests for models or prompts, showing active variants, traffic distribution, and performance metrics.

Historical Test Runs: Access to past test results for regression analysis.

Interaction: For creating and running tests, analyzing results, and managing A/B testing campaigns.
