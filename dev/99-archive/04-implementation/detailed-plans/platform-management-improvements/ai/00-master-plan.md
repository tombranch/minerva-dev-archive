# Platform AI Management System Redesign - Master Plan

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: PLATFORM ADMIN TOOL - NOT FOR END USERS

**THIS IS AN INTERNAL PLATFORM ADMINISTRATION TOOL**
- **Target**: Platform administrators, AI engineers, DevOps teams
- **Location**: `/app/platform/ai-management/` (existing platform admin area)
- **Access**: Platform admin role required (`platform_admin` in user_profiles table)
- **Purpose**: Manage AI infrastructure that powers end-user features
- **NOT**: A feature for Minerva app users or organization admins

## Executive Summary

Complete redesign of the **platform AI management system** from technical-centric to feature-centric architecture. This is an internal tool for platform administrators to optimize AI infrastructure (Photo Tagging, Chatbot, AI Search) that end-users consume through the main Minerva application.

**Key Distinction**: This system manages the AI infrastructure. End-users consume AI features through the regular Minerva app without seeing these management interfaces.

### Current Problems Identified

1. **Technical-Centric Organization**: Current AI management is organized by technical concerns (Live Status, Pipeline Control, etc.) rather than AI features
2. **Scattered Cost Analysis**: Spending/cost analysis is scattered across `/platform/costs` and AI management
3. **Fragmented Debug Tools**: Debug tools are separate in `/platform/debug/ai*`
4. **Duplicated Settings**: Settings are duplicated between `/platform/settings/ai-management` and the main AI console
5. **No Feature-Centric Workflow**: No clear feature-centric workflow for optimizing Photo Tagging, Chatbot, AI Search individually

### Proposed Solution

Transform the AI management system around **6 feature-centric views** that prioritize AI feature optimization while maintaining technical depth and simplifying workflows:

1. **Global Overview** (Executive/Manager View)
2. **Feature-Specific Dashboard** (Developer/Feature Owner View)
3. **Model & Provider Management** (MLOps/Architect View)
4. **Prompt Library & AI Assistant** (Prompt Engineer/Developer View)
5. **Spending Analytics & Control** (Finance/Management View)
6. **Testing & Experimentation** (Developer/QA View)

## Platform Admin Access Control

### Required Permissions
- **Primary Role**: `platform_admin` role in `user_profiles` table
- **Secondary Roles**: `ai_engineer`, `devops_engineer` (if implemented)
- **Authentication**: Must be authenticated platform team member
- **Route Protection**: All `/app/platform/ai-management/*` routes require platform admin access

### Integration with Existing Platform Structure
- **Existing Location**: `/app/platform/ai-management/` (currently has Live Status, Pipeline Control, Performance Analytics, Testing Lab)
- **Current Users**: Platform administrators already have access
- **Improvement Goal**: Transform existing technical-centric views into feature-centric management

## Implementation Strategy

- Database schema updates with proper access control
- Data migration scripts for platform admin data
- Internal API documentation for platform team

### Phase 3: Core View Implementation (Week 2-3)
**Agents**: code-writer + ui-ux-reviewer

- Implement the 6 core platform admin views in `/components/platform/ai-management/`
- Create reusable UI components for internal platform functionality
- Implement navigation within existing platform admin layout structure
- Ensure responsive design for platform team workflows
- **Ensure**: All components include platform admin access validation

**Key Deliverables**:
- React components for all 6 platform admin views
- Shared platform admin component library
- Navigation system integrated with existing platform structure
- Responsive layouts for internal team use

### Phase 4: Platform Integration & Testing (Week 3-4)
**Agents**: testing-strategist + quality-assurance-specialist

- Integrate new platform admin views with existing AI infrastructure management
- Implement comprehensive testing suite for platform admin functionality
- Performance optimization and security review of platform admin access
- User acceptance testing with internal platform team members
- **Focus**: Ensure seamless management of AI infrastructure that powers end-user features

**Key Deliverables**:
- Platform admin integration complete
- Test suite for internal management tools
- Performance optimization for platform workflows
- Security audit results for platform admin access

### Phase 5: Platform Migration & Deployment (Week 4-5)
**Agents**: devops-engineer + production-readiness-auditor

- Gradual migration from current platform admin system to improved feature-centric version
- Production deployment within existing platform admin infrastructure
- Platform team training and internal documentation
- Post-deployment monitoring for platform admin workflows
- **Scope**: Internal platform team deployment only

**Key Deliverables**:
- Platform admin migration procedures
- Production deployment within platform infrastructure
- Internal platform team training materials
- Platform admin monitoring dashboards

## Success Criteria

### Platform Admin Experience Improvements
- **Time Reduction**: 50% reduction in time for platform admins to find and modify AI infrastructure configurations
