## ðŸš¨ Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas

#### 1. Timeline Risks
- **Risk**: Complex integration tests take longer than estimated
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple test cases, add complexity iteratively
- **Contingency**: Extend timeline by 2 weeks if needed

#### 2. Resource Risks  
- **Risk**: Key developers unavailable during critical phases
- **Mitigation**: Cross-train multiple developers, document all patterns
- **Contingency**: Hire temporary specialized testing contractor

#### 3. Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Existing codebase difficult to test due to tight coupling
- **Mitigation**: Refactor as needed for testability, budget extra time
- **Contingency**: Accept lower coverage for legacy components

### Success Factors
1. **Executive Buy-in**: Ensure leadership supports the investment
2. **Team Training**: Provide testing best practices training
3. **Gradual Implementation**: Don't disrupt current development velocity
4. **Quality Gates**: Implement coverage gates in CI/CD pipeline
