## Mock/Fake Data Audit Update

### ‚úÖ No New Mock Data Issues Found

The comprehensive sweep confirmed the previous `mock-data-review.md` findings:

1. **Well-organized test infrastructure** - No issues found
2. **MSW handlers properly configured** - All functioning correctly
3. **Single hardcoded data issue** - `MOCK_PROJECTS` in `move-project-modal.tsx` (previously documented)
4. **No malicious content** - Security scan confirmed clean

### Test Infrastructure Status
- **Jest mock files**: Legacy files confirmed as historical (project uses Vitest)
- **Vitest mocks**: All properly organized and functioning
- **E2E fixtures**: Playwright test infrastructure confirmed working
- **API mocking**: MSW handlers comprehensive and production-ready

## Additional Findings

### Placeholder Text (Non-Critical)
Found various UI placeholder text throughout components:
- Form input placeholders (`placeholder="John"`, `placeholder="Select category"`)
- Search placeholders (`placeholder="Add custom tag..."`)
- **Status**: Normal UI placeholders, not implementation TODOs
- **Impact**: None - These are intentional user interface elements

Found references to "bug" in feedback system:
- `components/user/my-feedback.tsx` - Bug reporting functionality
- `components/feedback/` - Bug report forms and icons
- **Status**: Intentional bug reporting features, not actual bugs
- **Impact**: None - These are working features for user feedback

## Code Quality Assessment

### ‚úÖ Positive Findings

1. **Consistent Patterns**: All TODOs follow similar commenting and implementation patterns
2. **User Communication**: Appropriate "coming soon" messages for placeholder features
3. **No Dead Code**: No abandoned or broken code found
4. **Security Clean**: No suspicious or malicious code detected

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Areas for Improvement

1. **TODO Standardization**: Consider adding priority/effort indicators to TODO comments
