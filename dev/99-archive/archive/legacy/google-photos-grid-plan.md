# Google Photos Grid View Implementation Plan

## Overview
Transform the current photo grid view to match Google Photos' design with:
- Square/rectangular photo previews without gaps
- Auto-scaling row heights to fill horizontal space
- Date-based sorting with monthly groupings
- Remove modal testing debug code

## Current Analysis
Found key components:

### Main Photo Grid Components:
1. **`C:\Users\Tom\dev\minerva\components\photos\photo-grid.tsx`** - Main photo grid component
   - Three view modes: grid, masonry, and list
   - Dynamic responsive grid layout
   - Photo selection, interaction, and display logic

2. **`C:\Users\Tom\dev\minerva\app\dashboard\photos\page.tsx`** - Photos page container
   - Photo data fetching and filtering
   - **Debug panel with modal testing buttons (lines 321-411)**

### Debug Code Location:
- Yellow debug panel in photos page with "Test Photo Modal (Debug)" buttons
- Console.log statements in photo-detail-modal.tsx (lines 136, etc.)

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Remove Debug Code
- Remove debug panel from `app/dashboard/photos/page.tsx` (lines 321-411)
- Remove console.log statements from `components/photos/photo-detail-modal.tsx`

### 2. Implement Google Photos Style Grid
- Modify `components/photos/photo-grid.tsx` to use justified grid layout
- Create auto-scaling row heights that fill horizontal space
- Remove gaps between photos
- Maintain aspect ratios while fitting photos edge-to-edge

### 3. Add Date-based Grouping
- Sort photos by date (newest first) 
- Group by month/year with headers
- Add month separator components

### 4. Grid Layout Changes
- Replace current CSS Grid with justified grid algorithm
- Calculate optimal photo sizes for each row
- Implement smooth transitions and loading states

## Files to Modify
- `components/photos/photo-grid.tsx` - Main grid layout
- `app/dashboard/photos/page.tsx` - Remove debug panel
- `components/photos/photo-detail-modal.tsx` - Remove debug logs
- Add new date grouping utility functions
- Potentially add new month header components

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### 1. Remove Debug Code (Priority: High)
**File: `app/dashboard/photos/page.tsx`**
- Remove entire debug panel section (lines 321-411)
- Remove testDialogOpen state and related handlers
- Clean up console.log statements in debug handlers

**File: `components/photos/photo-detail-modal.tsx`**
- Remove debug console.log statements (line 136, etc.)
- Keep error console.error statements for production monitoring

### 2. Transform Grid Layout (Priority: High)
**File: `components/photos/photo-grid.tsx`**
- Replace current CSS Grid (lines 81-88) with Google Photos style justified grid
- Implement algorithm to:
  - Calculate optimal row heights based on available width
  - Maintain aspect ratios while scaling photos to fit rows
  - Remove gaps between photos (current has gap-4)
  - Auto-scale rows to fill horizontal space completely

**New Grid Algorithm:**
- Group photos into rows with optimal total width
- Calculate scale factor for each row to fill container width
- Apply transforms to maintain aspect ratios
- Use flexbox for row layout with no gaps

### 3. Add Date-based Grouping (Priority: Medium)
**File: `components/photos/photo-grid.tsx`**
- Sort photos by date (newest first) - currently uses sortBy from store
- Group photos by month/year 
- Add month headers between groups
- Format headers like "December 2024" or "November 2024"

**New Components to Create:**
- `MonthHeader` component for date separators
- Date grouping utility functions

### 4. Current State Analysis
**Photo Data Structure:**
- Photos have `created_at` and `taken_at` timestamps
- Current sorting handled by `sortBy` from photo-management-store
- Photos fetched via `usePhotos` hook with filters

**Current Grid Features to Preserve:**
- Three view modes (grid, masonry, list) - focus on grid mode
- Photo selection with checkboxes
- Action menus on hover
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive design for mobile

### 5. Technical Implementation Details
**Justified Grid Algorithm:**
```javascript
// Calculate optimal row layout
const calculateRowLayout = (photos, containerWidth, targetHeight) => {
  // Group photos into rows that fit within container width
  // Scale each row to exactly fill the container width
  // Maintain aspect ratios while scaling
}
```

**Date Grouping Logic:**
```javascript
// Group photos by month/year
const groupPhotosByMonth = (photos) => {
  // Sort by date (newest first)
  // Group by month/year
  // Return array of { month, year, photos }
}
```

## Notes
- Focus on grid view mode first (lines 81 in photo-grid.tsx)
- Preserve existing functionality: selection, actions, loading states
- Use shadcn/ui components for month headers
- Follow existing component patterns and TypeScript strict mode
- Test with existing photo data structure
