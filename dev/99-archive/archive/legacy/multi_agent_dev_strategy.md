# Multi-Agent Development Strategy
## Machine Safety Photo Organizer MVP

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** June 30, 2025  
**Development Timeline:** 12 weeks  
**Target Agents:** 8 specialized Claude Code agents

---

## 1. Overview & Strategy

### Development Approach
This document outlines a parallel development strategy using **Git worktrees** and **Claude Code agents** to accelerate MVP delivery. Each agent works on isolated features in separate worktrees, allowing simultaneous development while maintaining code quality and integration safety.

### Key Principles
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple agents work simultaneously on different features
- **Clean Integration**: Git worktrees prevent merge conflicts and enable safe feature integration
- **Clear Dependencies**: Agents understand what they need from previous work
- **Quality Focus**: Each agent includes comprehensive testing and documentation
- **Human Oversight**: Critical decisions and integrations managed by human developer

## 2. Git Worktree Architecture

### Repository Structure
```bash
photo-organizer/                    # Main repository
├── main/                          # Main branch worktree (integration)
├── foundation/                    # Agent 1: Foundation & Infrastructure
├── auth/                         # Agent 2: Authentication & User Management
├── upload/                       # Agent 3: Photo Upload & Storage
├── ai-processing/                # Agent 4: AI Processing & Tagging
├── search/                       # Agent 5: Search & Discovery
├── organization/                 # Agent 6: Organization & Export
├── feedback/                     # Agent 7: Feedback & Analytics
└── mobile-perf/                  # Agent 8: Mobile & Performance
```

### Initial Setup Commands
```bash
# 1. Create main repository and initial structure
git clone https://github.com/your-org/photo-organizer.git
cd photo-organizer

# 2. Create worktrees for each agent
git worktree add foundation -b feature/foundation
git worktree add auth -b feature/auth
git worktree add upload -b feature/upload
git worktree add ai-processing -b feature/ai-processing
git worktree add search -b feature/search
git worktree add organization -b feature/organization
git worktree add feedback -b feature/feedback
git worktree add mobile-perf -b feature/mobile-perf

# 3. Verify worktree setup
git worktree list
```

### Worktree Management
```bash
# Switch between worktrees
cd foundation/    # Work on foundation features
cd ../auth/       # Switch to auth features

# Keep worktrees updated
git worktree foreach git pull origin main

# Remove completed worktrees
git worktree remove foundation
git branch -d feature/foundation  # Clean up branch
```

## 4. Merge Strategy & Integration

### Sequential Merge Protocol

#### Pre-Merge Checklist
```bash
# Before merging any agent's work:
cd main/
git pull origin main                    # Ensure main is current
git merge feature/[agent-name]         # Merge agent branch
npm run build                          # Verify build works
npm run test                           # Run all tests
npm run lint                           # Check code quality
```

#### Integration Testing Steps
1. **Functional Testing**: Test the specific feature works as expected
2. **Integration Testing**: Ensure new feature works with existing features
3. **Performance Testing**: Check no performance regressions
4. **Mobile Testing**: Verify responsive design still works
5. **Database Testing**: Confirm migrations and schema changes work

#### Merge Timing
- **Agent 1**: Immediate merge after completion (foundation needed by all)
- **Agent 2**: Merge before Agent 3 starts (auth needed for uploads)
- **Agent 3**: Merge before Agent 4 starts (uploads needed for AI processing)
- **Agent 4**: Merge before Agents 5&6 start (tags needed for search/organization)
- **Agents 5&6**: Can develop in parallel, merge both before Agent 7
- **Agent 7**: Merge before Agent 8 (feedback system needed for performance testing)
- **Agent 8**: Final integration and optimization

### Conflict Resolution Strategy

#### Prevention
```bash
# Each agent starts from latest main
cd [agent-worktree]/
git pull origin main
git rebase main  # Ensure clean history
```

#### Resolution Process
1. **Identify Conflicts**: Use `git status` and review conflict markers
2. **Understand Changes**: Review both versions and understand intent
3. **Resolve Intelligently**: Combine changes or choose appropriate version
4. **Test Resolution**: Ensure resolution doesn't break functionality
5. **Document Decision**: Add commit message explaining resolution

## Appendix A: Emergency Procedures

### Critical Blocker Resolution
1. **Identify Impact**: Determine if blocker affects other agents
2. **Escalation Path**: Human review within 2 hours for critical blockers
3. **Workaround Strategy**: Implement temporary solution to unblock dependent work
4. **Resolution Timeline**: Set clear expectations for permanent fix

### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# If integration causes major issues
git revert [merge-commit]          # Revert problematic merge
git push origin main               # Update main branch
# Notify all agents of rollback
# Work with agent to fix issues before re-merge
```

### Communication Escalation
- **Minor Issues**: Document in daily check-in
- **Moderate Issues**: Immediate notification with 4-hour response SLA
- **Critical Issues**: Immediate resolution with all development paused if needed

This strategy ensures efficient parallel development while maintaining quality and integration safety throughout the MVP development process.
