# UX Simplification Project Overview

**Project Goal:** Transform Minerva from a complex 9-section navigation to a streamlined 5-section Google Photos-inspired interface while maintaining essential organizational features.

## Project Structure

This folder contains the complete planning documentation for the UX simplification project, divided into manageable agent assignments.

### üìã Master Document
- `google-photos-like-ux-simplification.md` - Complete strategy and requirements

### ü§ñ Agent Briefs
- `agent-1-smart-albums-brief.md` - Smart Albums Infrastructure (1 week)
- `agent-2-navigation-restructure-brief.md` - Navigation Restructure (3-4 days)
- `agent-3-photos-simplification-brief.md` - Photos Page Simplification (1 week)
- `agent-4-mobile-ui-enhancements-brief.md` - Mobile & UI Enhancements (1 week)
- `agent-5-search-ai-features-brief.md` - Search & AI Features (1 week)

## Git Worktree Implementation Strategy

**This project uses git worktrees for parallel development by multiple Claude Code agents.**

### Worktree Structure
```
minerva/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (main repository)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ worktrees/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent-1-smart-albums/     # Branch: ux/smart-albums
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent-2-navigation/       # Branch: ux/navigation
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent-3-photos/           # Branch: ux/photos-simplification
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent-4-mobile/           # Branch: ux/mobile-ui
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent-5-search/           # Branch: ux/search-ai
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/              # Branch: ux/integration
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ testing/                  # Branch: main (clean testing)
```

### Development Workflow
1. **Setup Phase**: Create all worktrees and VS Code workspace
2. **Parallel Development**: Agents work in isolated worktrees
3. **Integration**: Merge successful features to integration branch
4. **Testing**: Final testing in clean environment
5. **Deployment**: Merge to main when ready

## Project Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation (Parallel)
- **Agent 1**: Smart Albums Infrastructure (worktrees/agent-1-smart-albums)
- **Agent 2**: Navigation Restructure (worktrees/agent-2-navigation)
- Both agents can work simultaneously without conflicts

### Week 2: Core Features
- **Agent 3**: Photos Page Simplification (worktrees/agent-3-photos)
  - Can merge from Agent 1 & 2 branches as needed
- **Agent 4**: Mobile & UI Enhancements (worktrees/agent-4-mobile)
  - Starts building on Agent 2's navigation changes

### Week 3: Advanced Features
- **Agent 5**: Search & AI Features (worktrees/agent-5-search)
  - Integrates with all previous agent work
- Integration testing in dedicated worktree

### Week 4: Integration & Polish
- Merge successful features to integration branch
- Performance optimization and testing
- Final integration to main branch
- User testing and documentation

    A[Agent 1: Smart Albums] --> C[Agent 3: Photos Page]
    B[Agent 2: Navigation] --> C
    B --> D[Agent 4: Mobile UI]
    C --> E[Agent 5: Search & AI]
    D --> E
```

### Critical Path
1. Agent 2 (Navigation) must complete before others start UI work
2. Agent 1 (Smart Albums) API needed for Agent 3 integration
3. Agent 3 (Photos) simplification enables Agent 4 mobile work
4. Agent 5 (Search) builds on all previous work

## Documentation Requirements

Each agent must provide:

### üìù Progress Documentation
- Update documentation as work progresses
- Document design decisions and trade-offs
- Note any deviations from the brief

### üìã Handover Document
Create `HANDOVER-AGENT-X.md` with:
- What was implemented
- Architecture decisions
- Performance benchmarks
- Testing results
- Known limitations
- Future enhancement suggestions
- Dependencies for other agents

### üß™ Testing Results
- Unit test coverage
- Integration test results
- Performance benchmarks
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile device testing

## Quality Standards

- Rollback plan for each change
- Comprehensive testing before deployment
- Performance monitoring

### User Experience Risks
- User migration guides
- Training materials
- Support team preparation
- Feedback collection system

## Git Worktree Workflow

### Development Process
1. **Work in Your Worktree**: Each agent develops in their dedicated worktree
2. **Regular Commits**: Commit progress to your branch regularly
3. **Share Dependencies**: Push branches so other agents can access your work
4. **Merge When Needed**: Other agents can merge your branch into theirs
5. **Integration Testing**: Test combinations in the integration worktree

### Branch Management
```bash
# Agent workflow example
cd worktrees/agent-1-smart-albums
# Work on features
git add .
git commit -m "Implement smart albums API"
git push origin ux/smart-albums

# Other agents can now access this work
cd worktrees/agent-3-photos
git merge ux/smart-albums  # Get Agent 1's smart albums API
```

### Port Management
Each worktree can run on different ports:
```bash
# Agent 1
cd worktrees/agent-1-smart-albums && npm run dev -- --port 3001

# Agent 2  
cd worktrees/agent-2-navigation && npm run dev -- --port 3002

# Agent 3
cd worktrees/agent-3-photos && npm run dev -- --port 3003
```

## Communication Protocol

### Daily Updates
- Progress against brief objectives
- Git branch status and shared dependencies
- Any blocking issues or dependencies
- Design decisions requiring input
- Performance or technical concerns

### Dependency Coordination
- **Agent 3** depends on Agent 1 (smart albums API) and Agent 2 (navigation)
- **Agent 4** depends on Agent 2 (navigation) and Agent 3 (simplified photos)
- **Agent 5** depends on Agent 1 (smart albums) and Agent 3 (photos integration)

### Weekly Milestones
- Branch merge status and integration progress
- Completed features demo (which worktree/port)
- Cross-agent integration testing results
- Handover document progress
- Next week planning and branch coordination
