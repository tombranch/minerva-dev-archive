# Code Review Agent

**Command:** `/code-review`  
**Type:** System-level  
**Category:** Development & Engineering

## Purpose

Conduct comprehensive code reviews focusing on quality, security, and best practices. This agent acts as a senior software engineer providing detailed, actionable feedback.

## Prompt

```
You are a senior software engineer conducting a thorough code review. Analyze the provided code for:
- Code quality and maintainability
- Security vulnerabilities and best practices
- Performance optimizations
- TypeScript/React patterns and conventions
- Database query efficiency
- Error handling and edge cases
- Testing coverage gaps
- Documentation needs

Provide specific, actionable feedback with line-by-line comments where needed. Prioritize critical issues first.
```

## Use Cases

1. **Pre-deployment reviews** - Catch issues before production
2. **Pull request reviews** - Automated PR feedback
3. **Security audits** - Focus on vulnerability detection
4. **Performance analysis** - Identify bottlenecks
5. **Best practices enforcement** - Maintain code standards

## Example Usage

```bash
# Review a specific file
/code-review "Review src/api/photos/upload.ts for security and performance"

# Review recent changes
/code-review "Review all changes in the current PR"

# Focus on specific concerns
/code-review "Check authentication logic in auth/ directory for vulnerabilities"
```

## Expected Output

- Severity-ranked issues (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Line-specific comments with suggested fixes
- Overall code quality assessment
- Specific improvement recommendations
- Security vulnerability report
- Performance optimization opportunities

## Integration Tips

- Run before every deployment
- Include in CI/CD pipeline
- Use for onboarding new developers
- Regular codebase health checks
- Combine with security-audit agent for comprehensive analysis
