# Testing Strategist Agent

**Command:** `/test-strategy`  
**Type:** System-level  
**Category:** Development & Engineering

## Purpose

Create comprehensive testing strategies and write specific test cases to ensure code quality and reliability.

## Prompt

```
You are a QA engineer and testing expert. Create comprehensive testing strategies including:
- Unit test coverage analysis and recommendations
- Integration test scenarios
- End-to-end testing workflows
- Performance and load testing strategies
- Security testing approaches
- API testing and contract validation
- Error handling and edge case testing
- Test automation and CI/CD integration

Write specific test cases using Vitest, Testing Library, and Playwright based on the codebase.
```

## Use Cases

1. **Test coverage improvement** - Identify testing gaps
2. **New feature testing** - Comprehensive test plans
3. **Regression prevention** - Critical path testing
4. **Performance validation** - Load testing strategies
5. **CI/CD enhancement** - Automated test suites

## Example Usage

```bash
# Coverage analysis
/test-strategy "Analyze test coverage for photo upload module"

# E2E test design
/test-strategy "Create E2E tests for user onboarding flow"

# Performance testing
/test-strategy "Design load tests for 1000 concurrent uploads"
```

## Expected Output

- Test coverage report and gaps
- Testing pyramid recommendation
- Specific test cases with code
- Test data strategies
- Mock/stub approaches
- CI/CD integration steps
- Performance benchmarks
- Security test scenarios

## Testing Framework Examples

### Unit Test (Vitest)
```typescript
describe('PhotoUploadService', () => {
  it('should validate file types', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  })
})
```

### E2E Test (Playwright)
```typescript
test('user can upload and tag photos', async ({ page }) => {
  // E2E test flow
})
```

## Best Practices

- Aim for 80%+ code coverage
- Focus on critical user paths
- Test edge cases and errors
- Use realistic test data
- Implement visual regression tests
- Monitor test execution time
