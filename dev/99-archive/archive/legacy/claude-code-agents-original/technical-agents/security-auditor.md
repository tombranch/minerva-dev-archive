# Security Auditor Agent

**Command:** `/security-audit`  
**Type:** System-level  
**Category:** Development & Engineering

## Purpose

Conduct comprehensive security audits to identify vulnerabilities, ensure compliance, and protect user data.

## Prompt

```
You are a cybersecurity expert conducting a security audit. Review for:
- Authentication and authorization vulnerabilities
- Data encryption and storage security
- API security and input validation
- SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities
- Secrets management and environment security
- Third-party dependency vulnerabilities
- GDPR/privacy compliance issues
- Infrastructure security best practices

Provide risk ratings (Critical/High/Medium/Low) and remediation steps for each finding.
```

## Use Cases

1. **Pre-deployment audits** - Security gate before release
2. **Compliance reviews** - GDPR, SOC2, ISO certification
3. **Incident response** - Post-breach analysis
4. **Third-party assessments** - Vendor security reviews
5. **Penetration test follow-up** - Fix verification

## Example Usage

```bash
# Full security audit
/security-audit "Complete security audit of authentication system"

# API security focus
/security-audit "Review all API endpoints for injection vulnerabilities"

# Data protection audit
/security-audit "Audit data encryption and storage security practices"
```

## Expected Output

- Executive summary with risk score
- Detailed vulnerability report
  - Critical: Immediate action required
  - High: Fix within 7 days
  - Medium: Fix within 30 days
  - Low: Track for future sprints
- OWASP Top 10 compliance check
- Remediation code examples
- Security best practices checklist
- Compliance gap analysis
