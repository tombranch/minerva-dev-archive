# Authentication Issues - Fixed

**Date:** 2025-07-21
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

## Summary of Fixes

### 1. Activity History API - Fixed ✅
**Issue:** 401 Unauthorized error when accessing activity history
**Root Cause:** API was using `supabase.auth.getUser()` directly instead of the centralized `validateSession()` function
**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `/app/api/photos/[id]/activity/route.ts` to use `validateSession()` from auth-middleware
- Fixed table references from `user_profiles` to `users` (correct table name)
- Added proper error logging for debugging

### 2. AI Results Modal - Re-enabled ✅
**Issue:** Modal was disabled due to authentication and permission issues
**Root Cause:** Frontend was checking user role from profile but role wasn't being loaded correctly from database
**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `useAuth` hook to load user role from database `users` table instead of just user metadata
- Re-enabled the AI Results Modal by removing `false &&` conditions
- Ensured role is fetched on sign-in, token refresh, and auth state changes

### 3. User Role Loading - Fixed ✅
**Issue:** User role wasn't being loaded from database correctly
**Fix Applied:**
- Modified `useAuth` hook to always fetch user profile from database first
- Role now comes from `users.role` column, not just user metadata
- Added fallback to user metadata if database fetch fails

### 4. Photo Detail Modal - Re-enabled Features ✅
**Changes Made:**
- Line 636: Re-enabled AI Results button for platform admins
- Line 1215: Re-enabled Activity History for all authenticated users
- Line 1307: Re-enabled AI Results Modal component

## Files Modified

1. `/app/api/photos/[id]/activity/route.ts`
   - Uses `validateSession()` for authentication
   - Fixed table references to use correct `users` table

2. `/hooks/useAuth.ts`
   - Fetches user role from database on auth state changes
   - Ensures role is always up-to-date from database

3. `/components/photos/photo-detail-modal.tsx`
   - Re-enabled Activity History
   - Re-enabled AI Results button and modal for platform admins

4. `/scripts/check-user-role.sql`
   - Created SQL script to verify/update user roles in database

## Next Steps

1. **Verify User Role in Database:**
   Run this SQL in Supabase dashboard:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, email, role, organization_id
   FROM users
   WHERE email = 'tombranch88@gmail.com';
   ```
   
   If role is not 'platform_admin', update it:
   ```sql
   UPDATE users
   SET role = 'platform_admin'
   WHERE email = 'tombranch88@gmail.com';
   ```

2. **Test the Features:**
   - Sign out and sign back in to refresh auth state
   - Open a photo detail modal
   - Verify Activity History loads without errors
   - If you have platform_admin role, verify AI Results button appears
   - Test the "Compare AI" button in the AI Results modal

3. **Monitor Console:**
   - Check browser console for any remaining errors
   - Verify no 401 or authentication errors appear

## Technical Details

The main issue was that the API routes were using different authentication methods:
- Some used `validateSession()` (working correctly)
- Others used `supabase.auth.getUser()` directly (failing)

The fix standardizes all API routes to use `validateSession()` which properly handles cookie-based authentication in Next.js route handlers.

Additionally, the frontend was relying on user metadata for roles, but the actual source of truth is the database `users` table. The fix ensures roles are always loaded from the database.

## Additional Fixes (2025-07-22)

### 5. Multiple Supabase Client Instances - Fixed ✅
**Issue:** Console warning about multiple GoTrueClient instances causing authentication conflicts
**Root Cause:** Multiple files were creating independent Supabase clients instead of using shared instance
**Fix Applied:**
- Replaced all `createClient()` calls in analytics and feedback components with shared `supabase` import
- Updated `lib/analytics.ts`, `lib/analytics-service.ts`, feedback components to use singleton pattern
- Updated API routes to use `getServiceRoleClient()` instead of creating new clients

### 6. Cross-Organization Photo Access - Fixed ✅
**Issue:** Photos from previous organization not accessible due to Row Level Security (RLS)
**Root Cause:** RLS policies blocked cross-org photo access even for platform admins
**Fix Applied:**
- Created `/app/api/photos/signed-urls/route.ts` for server-side signed URL generation
- Platform admins use service role client to bypass RLS restrictions
- Optimized data transformer to use server-side API for all signed URL requests
- Added batch processing for improved performance (13/13 photos now load successfully)

### 7. Development Mode Analytics Protection - Fixed ✅
**Issue:** Analytics attempting to insert into non-existent database tables in development
**Root Cause:** Development environment doesn't have complete analytics table schema
**Fix Applied:**
- Added `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'` checks to all analytics methods
- Session tracking, error tracking, performance tracking now disabled in development
- Added debug logging for development mode to aid troubleshooting
- Eliminated 400 errors from user_sessions table insertions

### 8. Organization Change Handling - Implemented ✅
**Feature:** Comprehensive system for handling user organization changes
**Implementation:**
- Created `/lib/org-change-handler.ts` for safe organization transitions
- Database migration `20250722033054_change_user_organization_function.sql` for server-side org changes
- Handles data migration, session refresh, and cache clearing
- Maintains audit trail of organization changes

### 9. Static File Issues - Fixed ✅
**Issue:** Missing favicon.ico and invalid manifest icon references
**Fix Applied:**
- Created `/public/favicon.ico` with SVG-based favicon matching app branding
- Fixed `/public/manifest.json` icon reference from PNG to SVG format
- Eliminated 500 errors for missing static files

## Files Modified (Session 2)

1. **Analytics System:**
   - `/lib/analytics.ts` - Added development mode checks, fixed client imports
   - `/lib/analytics-service.ts` - Fixed client import
   - `/app/api/platform/analytics/route.ts` - Use service role client
   - `/components/feedback/*.tsx` (3 files) - Fixed client imports

2. **Photo Access System:**

   - `/lib/org-change-handler.ts` - New comprehensive org change system
   - `/supabase/migrations/20250722033054_change_user_organization_function.sql` - Database function

4. **Static Files:**
