# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Connection Handling & Offline Management

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** July 12, 2025  
**Parent Project:** Minerva Machine Safety Photo Organizer

---
### **MVP Implementation Scope (Lite Version)**

For the initial MVP, a "lite" version of connection handling will be implemented to provide essential resilience against intermittent network issues without the complexity of a full offline-first system.

**Primary Goal:** Prevent user frustration and data loss from temporary network drops during critical operations like photo uploads.

**MVP Features:**
*   **Automatic Upload Retries:** Leverage TanStack Query's built-in mutation retry logic. On network-related errors, failed photo uploads will be automatically retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff. This is a transparent background process.
*   **Simple Connection Status Indicator:** A global UI component (e.g., a small badge in the application header) will be implemented to show the user's current online/offline status based on the browser's `navigator.onLine` property.

**Out of Scope for MVP:**
*   The full offline operation queue using IndexedDB.
*   Service worker implementation for background sync.
*   Offline browsing of cached data.
*   Advanced conflict resolution.

The remainder of this document describes the **full, post-MVP implementation** of the comprehensive offline management system.

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1. Connection State Management

#### Real-time Connection Monitoring
```typescript
// Hook for connection status monitoring
export interface ConnectionStatus {
  isOnline: boolean;
  connectionType: 'wifi' | 'cellular' | 'ethernet' | 'unknown';
  isStable: boolean; // Based on recent success/failure patterns
  lastConnected: Date;
  reconnectAttempts: number;
}

// Global connection store
interface ConnectionStore {
  status: ConnectionStatus;
  pendingOperations: number;
  lastSyncTime: Date;
  syncInProgress: boolean;
}
```

#### Visual Connection Indicators
- **Header status indicator**: Online/offline badge with connection type
- **Toast notifications**: Connection loss/restoration alerts
- **Operation status badges**: Clear indicators for pending/syncing operations
- **Progress indicators**: Real-time sync progress for queued operations

### 5.2. Enhanced TanStack Query Configuration

#### Network-Aware Retry Strategy
```typescript
const networkAwareQueryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,
      retry: (failureCount, error: any, query) => {
        // Don't retry when offline
        if (!navigator.onLine) return false;
        
        // Enhanced retry logic based on error type
        if (isNetworkError(error)) {
          return failureCount < 5; // More retries for network errors
        }
        
        // Existing logic for other errors
        if (error?.status >= 400 && error?.status < 500) return false;
        return failureCount < 3;
      },
      retryDelay: (attemptIndex, error) => {
        // Exponential backoff with network awareness
        if (isNetworkError(error)) {
          return Math.min(1000 * 2 ** attemptIndex, 30000);
        }
        return Math.min(1000 * 2 ** attemptIndex, 10000);
      },
      networkMode: 'offlineFirst', // Cache-first strategy
    },
    mutations: {
      retry: (failureCount, error) => {
        // Queue mutations when offline instead of failing
        if (!navigator.onLine) {
          queueOfflineOperation(mutation);
          return false;
        }
        return failureCount < 3;
      },
      networkMode: 'offlineFirst',
    },
  },
});
```

#### Background Refetch on Reconnection
- Automatic background refetch of stale data when connection is restored
- Smart prioritization: critical data (auth, user profile) first, then photos
- Bandwidth-aware loading: throttled requests to prevent overwhelming slow connections

### 5.3. Offline Queue Management

#### Operation Queue Structure
```typescript
interface OfflineOperation {
  id: string;
  type: 'upload' | 'ai_process' | 'update_tags' | 'create_album' | 'delete_photo';
  payload: any;
  createdAt: Date;
  retryCount: number;
  priority: 'critical' | 'high' | 'normal' | 'low';
  dependencies?: string[]; // Other operation IDs this depends on
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed';
}

interface OfflineQueueStore {
  operations: OfflineOperation[];
  isProcessing: boolean;
  lastProcessedAt: Date;
  totalPending: number;
  failedOperations: OfflineOperation[];
}
```

#### Persistent Storage Strategy
- **IndexedDB**: Store queued operations, photos, and metadata
- **Automatic cleanup**: Remove old completed operations (older than 7 days)
- **Size management**: Implement LRU eviction for photo cache when storage limit reached
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest using Web Crypto API

#### Intelligent Retry Logic
- **Exponential backoff**: Progressive delays between retry attempts
- **Dependency management**: Ensure operations execute in correct order
- **Batch processing**: Group similar operations for efficiency
- **Error categorization**: Different retry strategies based on error type

### 5.4. Error Boundaries & Global Handling

#### React Error Boundaries for Network Failures
```typescript
export class NetworkErrorBoundary extends React.Component<Props, State> {
  // Catch network-related errors and provide fallback UI
  // Integrate with existing error handling system
  // Provide retry and queue options
}

export class QueryErrorBoundary extends React.Component<Props, State> {
  // Handle TanStack Query errors specifically
  // Reset queries on network restoration
  // Show appropriate offline/error states
}
```

#### Global Error Reset Mechanisms
- **Connection restoration**: Auto-reset failed queries when online
- **Manual retry controls**: User-initiated retry for failed operations
- **Bulk retry**: Option to retry all failed operations at once

### 5.5. Enhanced UI Components

#### Connection Status Components
```typescript
// Connection indicator in header
<ConnectionIndicator 
  status={connectionStatus}
  pendingCount={pendingOperations}
  onClick={() => showConnectionDetails()}
/>

// Operation status badges
<OperationStatus 
  operation={operation}
  showRetryButton={true}
  onRetry={() => retryOperation(operation.id)}
/>

// Offline banner
<OfflineBanner 
  isVisible={!isOnline}
  pendingCount={pendingOperations}
  onViewPending={() => showPendingOperations()}
/>
```

#### Enhanced Photo Upload Component
- **Offline queuing**: Photos added to upload queue when offline
- **Progress tracking**: Individual and batch upload progress
- **Retry controls**: Manual retry for failed uploads
- **Dependency indicators**: Show which uploads are waiting for others

#### Offline-Capable Photo Grid
- **Cached thumbnails**: Display previously loaded photos when offline
- **Placeholder states**: Clear indicators for photos not available offline
- **Optimistic updates**: Show changes immediately, sync when online
- **Conflict resolution**: Handle cases where same photo modified online/offline

## 6. Service Worker Implementation (Optional)

### Background Sync
```typescript
// Service worker for background synchronization
self.addEventListener('sync', (event) => {
  if (event.tag === 'photo-upload') {
    event.waitUntil(syncPhotoUploads());
  }
  if (event.tag === 'ai-processing') {
    event.waitUntil(syncAIProcessing());
  }
});

// Register background sync when operations are queued
navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((registration) => {
  return registration.sync.register('photo-upload');
});
```

### Cache Strategy
