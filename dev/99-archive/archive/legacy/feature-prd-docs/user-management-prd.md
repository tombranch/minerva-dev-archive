# Product Requirements Document (PRD): User Management & Admin Dashboard

**Document Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** July 14, 2025  
**Parent Project:** Minerva Machine Safety Photo Organizer  
**Phase:** Admin Interface Implementation for Beta Launch + Super Admin Platform Management

## 1. Introduction / Executive Summary

The Minerva Photo Organizer has a robust backend authentication and permission system with comprehensive database schema, RLS policies, and API endpoints. However, it lacks the admin dashboard and user management interface needed for effective team administration during the upcoming closed beta launch.

This PRD defines a comprehensive two-tier administration system:
1. **Organization Admin Dashboard** - For organization administrators to manage their team members, roles, permissions, and security settings
2. **Super Admin Platform** - For platform administrators to manage the entire system, including organizations, global users, API costs, and platform health

The implementation builds on the existing solid foundation of Supabase Auth, organization-based multi-tenancy, and audit logging infrastructure.

## 2. Current State Assessment

### ✅ **Existing Strong Foundation**
- **Database Schema**: Complete users, organizations, user_profiles tables with proper relationships
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth integration with JWT token handling and session management
- **Authorization**: Role-based system (admin/engineer/super_admin) with comprehensive RLS policies
- **Audit System**: Full audit logging with `audit_logs` table and middleware integration
- **API Infrastructure**: Auth middleware, organization services, and protected API routes
- **Backend Services**: `UserService` and `OrganizationService` classes with proper validation

### ❌ **Missing Admin Interface Layer**
- **Admin Dashboard**: No dedicated interface for organization administration
- **User Management UI**: No interface to view, invite, or manage organization members
- **Role Management**: No UI for promoting/demoting users between admin/engineer roles
- **Organization Settings**: No interface for managing organization-wide settings
- **Audit Log Viewing**: No dashboard to view security audit trails
- **User Invitation System**: No streamlined process for adding new team members
- **Super Admin Platform**: No platform-wide administration interface for developers
- **Global Analytics**: No cross-organization analytics and monitoring dashboard
- **Cost Management**: No global API cost monitoring and organization limit management
- **Platform Health**: No system-wide health monitoring and debugging tools

## 3. Goals & Success Criteria
