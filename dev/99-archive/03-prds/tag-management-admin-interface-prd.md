## Problem Statement & Goals

### Problem Statement

As the Minerva platform scales across multiple organizations and thousands of safety photos, several critical tag management challenges have emerged:

1. **Tag Proliferation:** Users create duplicate and near-duplicate tags ("Emergency Stop" vs "E-Stop" vs "Emergency Button")
2. **Inconsistent Categorization:** Similar concepts scattered across different tag categories
3. **Orphaned Tags:** Tags with zero photo associations consuming database resources
4. **Performance Degradation:** Tag search and autocomplete slowing as tag count increases
5. **Data Quality Issues:** Misspelled, incorrectly categorized, or inappropriate tags reducing AI effectiveness
6. **No Centralized Control:** No way for administrators to maintain tag quality at scale

### Primary Goals

1. **Centralized Tag Governance:** Provide platform administrators with comprehensive tag management capabilities
2. **Data Quality Improvement:** Reduce tag duplication and inconsistencies by 80%
3. **Performance Optimization:** Maintain sub-500ms tag search performance at 10,000+ tags
4. **Operational Efficiency:** Enable bulk operations to manage hundreds of tags simultaneously
5. **Analytics & Insights:** Provide data-driven insights for tag optimization decisions
6. **Audit Compliance:** Maintain complete audit trails for all tag modifications

### Success Metrics

- **Tag Quality Score:** Achieve 95% tag standardization (reduction in duplicates/variants)
- **Performance:** Tag search/autocomplete <500ms at 10,000+ tags
- **Usage Efficiency:** 80% of tags actively used (>0 photo associations)
- **Administrative Efficiency:** 60% reduction in tag management time
- **User Satisfaction:** 90% positive feedback on tag organization and findability
