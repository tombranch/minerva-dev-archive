## Minerva-Specific PRD Guidelines

### Domain Context
Always consider the machine safety engineering context:
- **Industrial Environment:** Harsh conditions, limited connectivity
- **Safety Critical:** Life safety and regulatory compliance requirements
- **Mobile First:** Primary usage on mobile devices
- **Multi-tenant:** Multiple organizations with data isolation

### Technical Stack Integration
Ensure alignment with Minerva's technology choices:
- **Next.js 15** with App Router and TypeScript strict mode
- **Supabase** remote database with RLS policies
- **shadcn/ui** components for consistent UI/UX
- **Google Cloud Vision** for AI processing
- **Vercel** deployment platform

### Performance Standards
Include specific performance requirements:
- **Upload Speed:** 20 photos in <2 minutes
- **AI Processing:** <5 seconds per photo
- **Search Response:** <500ms for query results
- **Mobile Load Time:** <3 seconds for initial page load

### User Experience Standards
Ensure excellent user experience:
- **Mobile Responsive:** Works perfectly on all device sizes
- **Touch Friendly:** Appropriate touch targets and gestures
- **Accessible:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Intuitive:** Follows established UI patterns

## PRD Template Variants

### Feature PRD Template
For new feature development:
```markdown
# [Feature Name] PRD

## Executive Summary
[Brief description and value proposition]

## User Stories
As a machine safety engineer, I want to...

## Technical Requirements
- Performance: [specific targets]
- Security: [security considerations]
- Mobile: [mobile-specific requirements]

## Implementation Plan
- Phase 1: [foundation work]
- Phase 2: [core features]
- Phase 3: [polish and optimization]

## Success Metrics
- [Primary KPI with target]
- [Secondary metrics]
```

### Enhancement PRD Template
For improving existing features:
```markdown
# [Feature] Enhancement PRD

## Current State Analysis
[What exists today and its limitations]

## Proposed Improvements
[Specific enhancements with rationale]

## User Impact
[How this improves user experience]

## Technical Approach
[Implementation strategy]

## Success Metrics
[Improvement measurements]
```

### Integration PRD Template
For third-party integrations:
```markdown
# [System] Integration PRD

## Integration Overview
[What system and why integrate]

## Data Flow
[How data moves between systems]

## Authentication & Security
[Security model for integration]

## Error Handling
[Failure scenarios and recovery]

## Success Criteria
[Integration success measures]
```

## Common PRD Patterns

### User Story Patterns
```markdown
# Photo Management
As a safety engineer, I want to organize photos by equipment type so that I can quickly find relevant safety documentation.

# Bulk Operations
As a safety manager, I want to download multiple photos as a ZIP file so that I can share them with external auditors.

# AI Assistance
As a field engineer, I want AI to automatically tag safety hazards in photos so that I can focus on corrective actions.
```

### Success Metrics Patterns
```markdown
# Adoption Metrics
- Feature usage rate: >70% of active users within 30 days
- Task completion rate: >90% successful completions
- User satisfaction: >4.2/5.0 rating

# Performance Metrics
- Response time: <500ms for 95th percentile
- Error rate: <1% of requests
- Availability: >99.9% uptime

# Business Metrics
- User productivity: 25% reduction in time to complete tasks
- Cost savings: 20% reduction in manual processing
- Compliance: 100% audit trail completion
```

## PRD Review Process

### Review Stages
1. **Self Review:** Author reviews against quality checklist
2. **Stakeholder Review:** Business stakeholders validate requirements
3. **Technical Review:** Engineering validates feasibility
4. **User Review:** Representative users provide feedback
5. **Final Approval:** Project sponsor approves for implementation

### Review Criteria
- **Clarity:** Requirements are clear and unambiguous
- **Completeness:** All necessary requirements included
- **Feasibility:** Technically achievable within constraints
- **Value:** Clear business and user value
- **Measurability:** Success criteria are quantifiable

## PRD Success Patterns

Based on Minerva's successful PRDs:

### What Works
- **Focused Scope:** Single feature or tightly related feature set
- **Clear Benefits:** Obvious value proposition for users
- **Technical Realism:** Achievable within current architecture
- **Measurable Outcomes:** Specific, quantifiable success criteria
- **User Validation:** Requirements validated with real users

### What to Avoid
- **Feature Creep:** Adding requirements during implementation
- **Vague Requirements:** Ambiguous or untestable requirements
- **Technical Debt:** Shortcuts that compromise long-term quality
- **Unrealistic Timelines:** Overly aggressive delivery schedules
- **Missing Context:** Insufficient background or user context

These templates and guidelines ensure consistent, high-quality PRDs that lead to successful feature implementations.
