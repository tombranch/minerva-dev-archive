# AI Features Page Redesign - Clarification Questions

Based on my review of the current AI features page implementation, I have several questions to ensure I understand your vision correctly:

## Core Structure Questions

1. **Do you want to completely eliminate the main features list page** (`/platform/ai-management/features`) and have users navigate directly to individual feature detail pages? 
   1. not for now. 

2. **Should the feature selection be moved to a sidebar navigation** instead of the current card-based grid layout?
   1. yes - make it seperate to the main sidebar. 

3. **For the Overview tab**: Do you want this to show both the feature description AND the current FeatureDashboard metrics, or should metrics be moved elsewhere?
   1. show both

4. **Should the stat cards currently shown in the main features list** be moved to the Overview tab of each individual feature? 
   1. overview tab

## Settings Tab Consolidation Questions

5. **Should the Settings tab include ALL configuration options** (models, prompts, rate limits, cost controls, monitoring) in one unified interface?
   1. yes

6. **Do you want model assignment to be a simple dropdown selector** within Settings rather than the current detailed dialog with model comparison?
   1. yes

7. **Should prompt management be simplified to just a list** within Settings without the separate detailed prompt editor dialogs?
   1. maybe - what do recomend?

8. **For the test functionality**: Should this be integrated directly into each settings section (e.g., a "Test Model" button next to model selection, "Test Prompt" next to prompt selection)?
   1. yes - i have an example you can see in the main app, photos detail, AI Results modal ther are some testing functions there. 

## Testing Implementation Questions

9. **What type of test input should be supported**: Real image uploads, text input, or both depending on the feature type?
   1.  yes real 

10. **Should test results be displayed inline** within the Settings tab or in a separate expandable section?
    1.  expandable

11. **Do you want to save/log test results** for comparison and debugging purposes?
    1.  yes - 

12. **Should there be predefined test cases** for each feature type (e.g., sample safety images for photo-tagging)?
    1.  yes 

## Logs and Monitoring Questions

13. **Should logs be accessible via a "View Logs" button** within the Settings tab that opens a modal/drawer?
    1.  drawer

14. **What level of log detail do you want**: Real-time streaming logs, searchable historical logs, or summary/aggregated log data?
    1.  realtime, and historical - with filter by time or type. 

15. **Should logs be filtered by environment** (dev/staging/prod) and time range?
    1.  yes

16. **Do you want different log types**: Error logs, performance logs, usage logs, or all combined?
    1.  combined but filterable

## Navigation and UX Questions

17. **Should users be able to bookmark/deep-link** to specific feature settings pages?
    1.  no

18. **Do you want breadcrumb navigation** showing "AI Management > Features > [Feature Name] > Settings"?
    1.  yes

19. **Should there be quick actions** (like disable/enable feature) accessible from the feature selection interface?
    1.  yes

20. **Do you want confirmation dialogs** for destructive actions like changing production models or deleting prompts?
    yes
## Performance and Data Questions

21. **Should the settings load all data upfront** or lazy-load sections as users interact with them?
    1.  lazy

22. **Do you want real-time updates** for metrics and status information while users are on the Settings tab?
    1.  yes

23. **Should there be a "save/apply changes" workflow** or should changes take effect immediately?
    1.  yes

24. **Do you want version control/rollback capabilities** for model and prompt changes?
    1.  yes
