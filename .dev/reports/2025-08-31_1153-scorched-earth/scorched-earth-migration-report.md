  - AI processing pipeline integration
  - Upload progress monitoring

### 🧹 PHASE 4: CLEANUP (Aggressive Deletion)
- ✅ **API Routes Cleanup** - Deleted entire directories:

  - `app/api/health/` - Health check endpoints
  - `app/api/photos/[id]/notes/` - Notes functionality
  - `app/api/dashboard/` - Dashboard endpoints
  - `app/api/user/` - User management routes
  - `app/api/create-org/` - Organization creation
  - `app/api/debug-user/` - Debug endpoints
  - `app/api/check-user/` - User check endpoints
- ✅ **Broken AI Services** - Deleted non-functional AI routes:
  - `app/api/health/ai-services/`
  - `app/api/photos/bulk-generate-descriptions/`
