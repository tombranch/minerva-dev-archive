## üìã Specific Technical Issues to Address

### **High Priority TypeScript Fixes**

1. **Authentication Type Issues** (app/(auth)/)
   ```typescript
   // Missing methods in useAuth hook
   app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx(28,11): Property 'resetPassword' does not exist
   app/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx(31,11): Property 'updatePassword' does not exist
   app/(protected)/admin/layout.tsx(15,21): Property 'user' does not exist on UseAuthReturn
   ```

2. **Legacy Supabase References** (app/(protected)/photos/)
   ```typescript
   // page-original.tsx contains Supabase-era code
   Property 'user_metadata' does not exist on user object
   Property 'refetch' does not exist (TanStack Query pattern mismatch)
   Implicit 'any' types throughout component
   ```

3. **Component Integration Issues**
   ```typescript
   // Type mismatches in photo components
   Type 'string | boolean | undefined' not assignable to 'boolean | undefined'
   Parameter implicitly has 'any' type (multiple locations)
   ```

### **Build Configuration Issues**

1. **Dynamic Route Naming** - ‚úÖ RESOLVED
   - Fixed conflicting [id] vs [photoId] parameter names
   - Standardized on [photoId] throughout API routes

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Verify .env.production configuration
   - Ensure all Convex and Clerk environment variables set correctly
   - Validate build-time environment access

### **Test Infrastructure Issues**

1. **Metadata Lookup Warnings**
   - 20+ warnings about "All promises were rejected" 
   - Indicates configuration issues with test database or mock setup
   - Likely causing test failures and unreliable test results

2. **Test Configuration Mismatch**
   - Tests expecting certain mock patterns that don't match current implementation
   - Test database setup issues
   - Environment variable mismatches in test configuration

## üìù Conclusion

The Convex-Clerk migration project represents a **mixed success** with excellent foundational work (TDD implementation, backend functions, documentation) but **critical integration and completion gaps** preventing deployment.

**The good news**: The hard architectural decisions have been made and much of the complex backend work is complete.

**The challenge**: Significant technical debt has accumulated, requiring systematic resolution before the project can be considered truly complete.

**The path forward**: A focused 7-day sprint addressing TypeScript errors, completing authentication, eliminating legacy code, and validating integration will bring this project to true production readiness.

**Recommendation**: Use either `/plan-tdd` or `/plan` commands to create a comprehensive implementation plan addressing all identified issues. The TDD approach is recommended given the success of previous TDD phases and the need for systematic validation of fixes.

---

**Review Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**  
**Next Action**: Create implementation plan using `/plan-tdd` or `/plan` command  
**Urgency**: **HIGH** - Production deployment currently impossible  
**Confidence Level**: **HIGH** - Issues are well-identified and addressable
