- **Technical challenges**: Complex integration issues
- **Performance problems**: Optimization needs
- **Security concerns**: Access control or data protection issues

### **Gap Categories**:
- üö® **CRITICAL**: Blocks phase completion or breaks functionality
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH**: Significant impact on user experience or performance
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **MEDIUM**: Important but not blocking 
- üí° **LOW**: Nice-to-have improvements or future enhancements

### **Gap Status Types**:
- üî¥ **OPEN**: Newly discovered, needs attention
- üü° **IN_PROGRESS**: Currently being worked on
- üü¢ **RESOLVED**: Completed and validated
- ‚ö™ **DEFERRED**: Will be addressed in future work

## üö® **Critical Gap Management**

### **Critical Gap Protocol** (üö® CRITICAL gaps):
1. **Immediate escalation** - Stop current work, focus on gap
2. **Root cause analysis** - Understand why gap wasn't anticipated  
3. **Impact assessment** - Determine effect on timeline and quality
4. **Solution options** - Identify multiple approaches to resolution
5. **Decision and action** - Choose best approach and implement
6. **Validation** - Verify resolution completely addresses issue
7. **Prevention** - Update planning to prevent similar gaps

### **High Priority Gap Protocol** (‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH gaps):
1. **Document thoroughly** - Capture all relevant details
2. **Assess alternatives** - Identify workaround options
3. **Plan resolution** - Schedule gap resolution work
4. **Implement solution** - Address gap systematically  
5. **Validate thoroughly** - Ensure complete resolution
6. **Update documentation** - Reflect changes in plans

## üìà **Learning & Improvement**

### **Common Gap Patterns** (To be populated):
*This section will identify recurring gap types for future planning improvement*

### **Planning Improvements** (To be populated):
*This section will document lessons learned for better future planning*

### **Process Refinements** (To be populated):  
*This section will capture process improvements based on gap experiences*

## üîÑ **Gap Workflow Integration**

### **Discovery Process**:
1. **Immediate logging** - Record gap as soon as discovered
2. **Initial assessment** - Categorize and prioritize
3. **Notify team** - Communicate significant gaps
4. **Plan resolution** - Develop approach to address gap
5. **Track progress** - Update status regularly
6. **Validate resolution** - Confirm gap fully addressed
7. **Update planning** - Incorporate lessons learned

### **Integration with Implementation**:
- **Check GAPS-LOG.md regularly** during implementation
- **Update gap status** in real-time as work progresses  
- **Reference gaps** when updating MASTER-TRACKER.md
- **Use gaps** to improve subsequent phase planning
- **Document patterns** for future project improvement

## üìû **Gap Escalation**

### **When to Escalate**:
- **Critical gaps** that block phase completion
- **Multiple high-priority gaps** in a single phase
- **Gaps requiring architecture changes** beyond current scope
- **Gaps with significant time impact** (>25% of phase time)
- **Security or data integrity gaps** requiring immediate attention

### **Escalation Process**:
1. **Document gap completely** with all available details
2. **Assess impact** on overall project timeline and quality
3. **Prepare options** including workarounds and full solutions
4. **Present to stakeholders** with recommendations
5. **Get decision** on how to proceed
6. **Update plans** based on decision
7. **Communicate changes** to all affected parties

```
**Gap ID**: P1-001
**Category**: üö® CRITICAL

**Phase**: Phase 1
**Discovery**: During package.json cleanup, discovered critical dependency conflict
**Description**: Removing supabase package breaks @supabase/ssr dependency used by Clerk

**Root Cause**: Dependency analysis missed transitive dependencies
**Solution**: Updated Clerk configuration to remove Supabase SSR dependency
**Resolution**: Modified auth configuration, tested build success

**Time Impact**: +30 minutes to phase
**Discovered By**: Implementation team
**Resolved By**: Implementation team  
**Date Discovered**: 2025-08-31
**Date Resolved**: 2025-08-31

**Phase**: Phase 2
**Discovery**: During Convex file storage implementation
**Description**: Original file storage approach doesn't support batch uploads
**Impact**: Upload workflow needs redesign, affects user experience
**Root Cause**: Planning assumed simple file upload, didn't consider batch requirements
**Solution**: Implement Convex file storage with batch upload support
**Resolution**: [In progress]
**Validation**: [Pending]
