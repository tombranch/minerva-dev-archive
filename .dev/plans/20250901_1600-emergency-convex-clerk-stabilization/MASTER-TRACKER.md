---

## üìã **PHASE 7: TypeScript & Code Quality Resolution** (READY)
**Status**: üü° **READY TO START**
**Objective**: Eliminate TypeScript errors and `any` type violations for production-grade code quality
**Estimated Duration**: 8-12 hours
**Priority**: HIGH - Required for maintainable production deployment

### Technical Debt to Address:
- **898 TypeScript errors** across 134 files (documented technical debt)
- **276 `any` type violations** violating project zero-tolerance policy

3. **ESLint Compliance** - Fix import sorting, unused variables, and hooks dependencies
4. **Type Safety Restoration** - Ensure strict TypeScript compliance
5. **Clean Commit Validation** - Remove need for `--no-verify` flags

## üö® **Current Blockers & Issues**

### **Critical Issues**
1. **Missing Auth Methods** - resetPassword, updatePassword not implemented (Phase 1)
2. **Legacy Code Conflicts** - Supabase patterns preventing integration (Phase 2)
3. **Type System Broken** - 1,037 errors blocking compilation (Phase 3)
4. **Test Suite Failing** - 27% failure rate (Phase 5)
5. **Build Failure** - Cannot create production artifacts (Phase 6)

### **Resolved Issues**
- ‚úÖ Dynamic route naming conflict ([id] vs [photoId]) - Fixed during review

---

## üéØ **Next Actions**

### **Immediate (Phase 1 Start)**
1. üî¥ **Implement missing auth methods** - Add resetPassword, updatePassword, initializeAuth
2. üî¥ **Fix user type mappings** - Align Clerk user structure with app expectations
3. üî¥ **Update auth pages** - Use new methods in forgot/reset password pages

### **Today's Goals**
1. Complete Phase 1: Authentication System Core Fix
2. Start Phase 2: Legacy Code Elimination
3. Achieve first successful TypeScript compilation (even if partial)

### **This Week's Targets**
1. Complete all 6 phases
2. Achieve zero TypeScript errors
3. Restore >95% test pass rate
4. Successfully build for production
5. Deploy to staging environment

---

## üìù **Notes & Decisions**

### **Key Decisions Made**
1. **No backward compatibility needed** - Feature branch allows breaking changes
2. **Complete Clerk integration** - No hybrid auth patterns
3. **Pure Convex backend** - Remove all Supabase code
4. **Strict TypeScript** - Zero tolerance for type errors
5. **TDD not required** - Focus on fixing existing code first

### **Implementation Guidelines**
- Each phase must be 100% complete before moving to next
- Use TodoWrite for micro-progress tracking within phases
- Update this tracker after each significant milestone
- Document gaps in GAPS-LOG.md for immediate resolution
- Run validation after each phase completion

### **Risk Mitigation**
- Feature branch protects production
- Systematic approach prevents scope creep
- Continuous validation catches issues early
- Comprehensive testing before deployment
